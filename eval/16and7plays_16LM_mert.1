i am no villain . 
give it me ! 
you mean i should groan and tell you ? 
curse the day ! 
he was not born to be unnoble . 
if i can trust my dreams , then some joyful news is coming anon . 
either thee , or i , or both of us have to go with him . 
he killed thy kinsman , brave mercutio , and then young romeo slew him . 
how canst thou be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that thou 're out of breath ? 
o painful , painful , painful day ! 
why , here 's the vial . 
and what of that ? 
i 'm glad he was would not here for this fight . 
i would the fool were dead and married to her grave ! 
but he 's not better than mine . 
take me in some house , benvolio , or i 'll pass out . 
his love is blind , so it lights in the dark . 
i 'm done . 
i may read mine own fortune in my woes . 
i did upbraid you for obsessing of her , not for loving her , my student . 
o love ! 
thrice-welcome in mantua . 
i 'll sting thee on the ear for that jest . 
welcome , gentlemen . 
hold the friar too . 
he is the son and heir of old tiberio . 
did he hence clean ? 
can i would not speak ? 
well , sir , for silver hath a sweet sound . 
i 'll frown upon them as they pass by , and they can react recalled they will . 
romeo will answer the challenge . 
in my desperate condition , i have to act alone . 
madam , i 'm here . 
now , i swear , i 'm so angry that i 'm shaking of all over . 
as i slept under this yew-tree here , i had a dream that my master and one else were fighting and that my master slew him . 
is it that early in the day ? 
romeo is hateful , though god is would not . 
what kind of devil art thou to torturest me thus ? 
so i die with a kiss . 
but here come some people , in the nick of time . 
i 'll make thee sing . 
i would i was your bird . 
any man who knows how to write can answer a letter . 
did a dragon ever hide me in such a fair cave ? 
do you would not have a letter for me from the friar ? 
peter , stay for me at the gate . 
go tell him of this . 
what say you , james well , i would not know what to say . 
i 'll go call the watch . 
what shall we say is our excuse for being here ? 
give me my sin back . 
who is her mother ? 
i 'll confess to thee that i love him . 
young man , something 's wrong if you 're grow out of bed this betimes . 
there were twenty montagues fighting in this abominable rise , and together those twenty could but kill one man . 
truly , cousin , i love a woman . 
investigate how this foul murder came of . 
what a man , young lady . 
if love is blind , it may would not hit the shot and danger . 
perchance you 've learned of life and not from books . 
tybalt was my cousin ! 
where the devil can romeo be ? 
as i remember , this should be the house . 
you 're marvelous too angry . 
fie on romeo ! 
tell me , my good friend , what is that light yonder ? 
who 's that calls so loud ? 
everyone prepare to take this fair corse to her grave . 
o pain ! 
now he 's ready for 
is it true ? 
that 's very shortly . 
but to be bounteous and give it thee once more . 
where is my mother ? 
monday ! 
to our house . 
what hast thou found out ? 
that 's how weak and unreal pleasure is . 
wilt thou assist them ? 
you may would not talk of something that you do would not feel . 
shall i go away while my heart sticks here ? 
look , sir , here comes the lady walking toward my cell . 
ay , madam , he lies beyond my pelt . 
what is the matter ? 
a fair shot and danger is the one that shows hit the fastest . 
no , not till thursday . 
i 'll give him equivocal thanks , so we 're even . 
peace , you mumbling fool ! 
tell me , how did you hither ? 
tell me , my daughter juliet , what is your disposition of married ? 
you were never with me for anything if thou wert would not there for the goose . 
or shall we enter without apologizing ? 
romeo , hence . 
this is a miserable sight ! 
are you mean to wash him out of his grave with tears ? 
well , well , i would not care . 
can would not thou find a reason without my giving you one ? 
that 's him , that villain romeo . 
do you need my help ? 
o my , o my ! 
come , what did romeo say ? 
his son was a hope but two years ago . 
nurse ! 
take this . 
come ! 
sola ! 
but what say you to my request ? 
we 're talking here in a common place . 
you 're in love ? 
he looks slight , like a dried herring without his eggs , and he hath would not bought his girl . 
oh , my ! 
thou liest . 
have a good day ! 
i would not know , and he will would not tell me . 
no , my good lord . 
thy life surety ? 
what says romeo say ? 
saint francis , help me ! 
hide yourself , good romeo . 
what do you mean the life of out thee ? 
i am the youngest man by that name , for there is no one younger , or worse . 
father , what news ? 
it 's still long till day . 
you will also confess , i 'm sure , that thou lovest me . 
sola , bride ! 
have you told her our mind ? 
i warrant it 's a challenge . 
well , may peace be with you . 
dinner is past , and we 're going to get there too late . 
you 're not taking one step toward an enemy . 
what , are you hurt ? 
look , she 's come home from confession with a merry look on her face . 
then that took my letter to romeo ? 
chaste treasure open makes her look sick and green . 
it 's late . 
do you would not see that i 'm out of breath ? 
do as i tell you . 
if we look like musicians to thee , thou expect to hear nothing but noise . 
is she would not proud of such a match ? 
oh , what a woeful day ! 
do would not deny to him that thou lovest me . 
how canst thou bring them so ? 
the boy is warning me that one comes . 
why , may i ask ? 
but what mishaps occur , they can would not athwart the joy i feel with one look on her . 
god choose you to receive his grace . 
do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to chide me . 
no , cousin , i 'm crying . 
she will a bawd ! 
commend me to your daughter . 
do you bring me a letter from the friar ? 
good morrow to you both . 
dispatch , ' tis execution of late . 
from henceforth , take heed of your messages yourself . 
wilt thou tarre me ? 
where are they supposition to come ? 
ay , boy , i 'm ready . 
o heavens ! 
will he would not ? 
for a full half hour . 
she 's ready to go , but she 'll never return . 
do would not fear me . 
how should madmen hear , if wise men may would not even see ? 
she disgusts me , the little wanton ! 
they 're wishest for dates and quinces in the pastry kitchen . 
o woeful day ! 
i ask that again for nothing can be wrong if she is well . 
the hence ! 
my soul depends on it- a thousand times good night . 
i know all of this . 
are they thus washing out his wounds with their tears ? 
up . 
by my count , i was already your mother at just of your age , whilst you close a maid . 
what 's this noise ? 
o flesh , flesh , thou 've turned pale and weak like a fish . 
i pray you , sir , have patience . 
are you a man ? 
if i were in the use of fighting the way you are , my life surety rates would be sky high . 
i hear some noise . 
begin a fight ? 
you should go to juliet and frock her up . 
well , begin thinking of marriage now . 
ay , pilgrim-they have lips that they 're supposition to pray with . 
oh , rough and unthankful boy ! 
that 's the way to show me love . 
i warrant he slipped away and went to bed . 
why are you knocking so hard ? 
ay , that 's true . 
but look on me , and i 'm invincible against their hatred . 
i hear a noise within . 
hang out ? ” who do you think we are , musicians in a band ? 
come hither , man . 
am i like one of those masters ? 
ay , ay , this is the rope ladder . 
i 'll go , sir , and i will would not trouble thee . 
what further pain must i endure in my age ? 
whose house ? 
no , noble romeo , you must 've caper . 
god bless thee ! 
answer me like men . 
god in heaven bless her ! 
i know where he is . 
down with the montagues ! 
how long hath he been there ? 
no matter . 
do you love me ? 
oh , deadly sin ! 
the sun itself hath never seen any as fair since the world began . 
but i 'm counsel for something i have . 
i would not know his name . 
farewell ! 
answer that question . 
send thy man away . 
give me some comfort , nurse . 
this is good . 
was ever such an evil book with such a fair cover ? 
why are you grating so angry ? 
god in heaven bless thee . 
that might be the case sir , 
madam ! 
it was . 
go with me to the monument . 
thy mother . 
lose nothing ? 
down with the capulets ! 
who is it ? 
pardon me , sir , do you know how to read ? 
amen ! 
my noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ? 
farewell , cousin . 
why , she 's within . 
or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter . 
why the hell did you come in between us ? 
you 're not attend me to me . 
so the feeds who can would not lick their fingers are would not did suborn . 
who should now pay the price for mercutio 's life ? 
where is my romeo ? 
pray you , hark , sir . 
have you spoke to him ? 
that 's indeed news ! 
it 's a sweet lozenge that you choke on . 
where is she ? 
give me my fan , peter . 
i 'll come with you . 
no , sir . 
come , awake , awake , awake ! 
she 's talking , but she 's not say anything . 
o my ! 
for when you cut your shin . 
are you going to tell me that ? 
what think you of thursday ? 
that sounds like the voice of friar john . 
do as you please , for i 'm done fearing you . 
tarry , tybalt , soft ! 
but i should kill you by petting thee too much . 
let me stand here till you remember your reason . 
i will be brief because i 'm not going to live long enough to tell a dry tale . 
let me speak to thee of thy complaining . 
is that would not what he said ? 
take my remark in choice sense you please . 
ay , well , things could get better . 
forget of him , jack sauce ! 
nurse ? 
good man , wherefore weep you ? 
can your man keep counsel ? 
what ? 
the prince will give you the judgement if you grow caught . 
he knows what ? 
i 'll answer for you . 
now you know the reason for the sweep . 
it 's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise . 
you 're an saucy little boy . 
i remember very well where i should be , and here i am . 
madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of paris . 
unhappy fortune ! 
but i am thankful that you have found it . 
what else is love ? 
lie down right there . 
no . 
well then . 
how does my juliet ? 
well then , i 'll say this quickly : the valiant paris desires you as his bride . 
then you were right on shot and danger . 
monday , my lord . 
were you wrap juliet ? 
do would not say nothing else . 
you know too much of distress . 
what ? 
where else would she be ? 
good morrow , masters . 
you 'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason . 
stand up . 
hold on , then . 
good night , good night . 
how is she ? 
that 's foolish . 
why , is would not all this jest better than groaning of love ? 
hark , your romeo will be here tonight . 
hath romeo killed himself ? 
on thursday , sir ? 
thou couldst not foreign her from dying ’ st , but heaven will give her eternal life . 
dispatch , or i 'll cuff you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn . 
what , art thou busy ? 
so did i. 
and trust me , love , you look pale to me too . 
you vainer girl ! 
give me your hand . 
what art thou girl ? 
was that my father who left here in such a haste ? 
how does my wife ? 
use your cudgels and spears ! 
o my ! 
what is this ? 
this fight will fall who dies . 
tybalt is lying yonder . 
mine eyes were liars , then , for i never saw true beauty before tonight . 
i have forgot why i called you in again . 
the citizens are about , and tybalt is dead . 
if there were two men like you , pretty soon there 'ld be none for the two of you would kill each other . 
oh , noise ? 
you will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing . 
are you going ? 
he struck me under your arm . 
madam , your mother desires to speak with you . 
do would not saints and pilgrims have lips too ? 
the other girl did not love me . 
i would not know , sir . 
beshrew your family ! 
teach me to forget to think ! 
why dost thou look so distempered ? 
madam , i am not well . 
it makes me mad . 
she 's lying on the ground approves him , blubbering and weep , weeping and blubbering . 
oh , you 're wrong . 
oh , away ! 
go to your bedchamber . 
benvolio is part of the montague house . 
perchance she can would not find him . 
i do . 
tell him so yourself , and see how he takes the news . 
let 's go at it , coward ! 
let me keep weep for such a great loss . 
i have my naked sword out . 
wife ! 
and why , wise lady ? 
here comes the furious tybalt again . 
you mean their cut off their heads , take their maidenheads-whatever . 
can you would not wait for a moment ? 
we 're marred , lady , we 're marred ! 
prithee , young man , do would not make me angry . 
i will kiss your lips . 
why would you do so , my love ? 
by nine o 'clock . 
gregory , remember how to score . 
nurse , commend me to to your lady . 
girls younger than she oft marry and become happy mothers . 
and it 's good to have joy in such a joyless time . 
where do you come from ? 
is my father well ? 
i strike hard when i 'm angry . 
oh , wilt thou leave me so unstanched ? 
a greater power than we can fight hath marred our course . 
then do my lips now have the sin they took from yours ? 
stop crying . 
it 's but even now nine o 'clock . 
o coz , coz ! 
what should i swear by ? 
well , we were all born to die . 
if he hears thee , thou 'll anger him . 
you should be able to endure this for the world is broad and wide . 
do you would not have one word of joy ? 
you , prince , are the man who can give me justice . 
so hence ! 
be quiet , for shame ! 
tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ? 
i 'll follow after you . 
well , we may put up our pipes and get you home . 
either put up your sword or use it to help me hold this fight . 
what , you do would not say a word ? 
then she is well , and nothing is wrong . 
my sweet , so do i. 
i swear , it must be thirty years . 
well , that one , i think , is young petruchio . 
would me fortune . 
what 's all the noise in here ? 
if i answered that question , i 'ld be making confession to you . 
she 's dead , like a fair flower , killed by an unseasonable frost . 
that dirty rat ! 
what i 'm saying can would not anger him . 
you 're a lover . 
my dream told me that dreamers oft lie . 
but why , thou villain , didst thou kill my cousin ? 
madam , good night . 
then i 'll indeed give it to you . 
give me those flowers . 
romeo killed tybalt . 
leave me and do what i told you to do . 
give me your torch , boy . 
i 'm suddenly fear . 
here comes your father . 
a jealous woman , a jealous woman ! 
what ? 
take away the stools , the sideboards , and the plates . 
it 's all the same . 
i 've said nothing wrong . 
the excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself . 
destructive thoughts come apace to the minds of desperate men ! 
stay . 
are you biting your thumb at us ? 
i 'll bring you there . 
what of that ? 
well , you 're not on shot and danger there . 
it 's out of fashion to give lengthy explanations so . 
are you begin to a fight ? 
i 'll fight you . 
tybalt , i have a cause to love you that lets me put aside the rage i should feel and excuse that injury . 
my husband lives on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven . 
i 'm spoiled in this world , i believe . 
noble mercutio , put up your sword . 
fie upon thee ! 
i would stay more than i will go . 
commend me to your lady , and tell her to dispatch all in the house to bed . 
call to him , mercutio . 
she 's too fair and too wise deserved heaven 's blessing by making me proclaims . 
why , what 's tybalt 's history ? 
two of the brightest stars in the whole ever-fixèd pole had to go away on business , and they 're questioned her eyes to twinkle in their steads till they return . 
whether it 's even or odd , of all the days in the year , on the night of lammas eve , she 'll be fourteen . 
have you killed tybalt ? 
you speak well . 
romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us . 
if i live to see you get married ’ st , all my fancies will come true . 
tell us what you know of this affair . 
i 'ld give anything to hinder them from seeing you here . 
do you think it 's good to crush ? 
what will you give us ? 
angry enough to run away . 
the right . 
there 's foison of time . 
my lord , you 're wrong to berate her so . 
farewell . 
benvolio , who began this fight ? 
take a little sequester in of mantua . 
what would you ? 
melancholy takes away our color . 
oh , that most wicked fiend ! 
i ’ ll have my sword . 
arise , man ! 
come hither , nurse . 
come , death , and welcome ! 
three words , dear romeo , and then it 's good night for sterling . 
what 's playing , juliet ? 
death , which hath ta 'en her away to make me cry , now ties up my tongue and will would not let me speak . 
why are you pause ? 
who doth salute me so early in the morning ? 
there was never been so black a day as today . 
i see . 
why , let 's fight , boy ! 
romeo . 
what does he say of our marriage ? 
o life ! 
what villain , madam ? 
give my praises to your lady . 
i will would not miss any chance to send my love to you . 
i 'm received to keep the peace . 
can god be so jealous and hateful ? 
and all will be day , i warrant you , wife . 
is the worst well ? 
oh , pardon me for bringing this bad news , but you told me it was my office , sir . 
i 've found it out . 
what if this mingle doth would not work at all ? 
methought it was the right to do . 
is love indeed tender ? 
that 's for the murderer lives . 
good night . 
a woman more beautiful than i adore ? 
not i , believe me . 
hold him in custody till the prince quit here . 
i will would not fail . 
oh , brother montague , give me your hand . 
we found him in the churchyard . 
i think he told me paris was about to marry juliet . 
romeo ! 
was i even close to you in the chase for the goose ? 
it 's not the time to play . 
away , and stay asunder from me . 
mistress ! 
is it young romeo ? 
bid her come to me . 
look , and you 'll see . 
gentlemen , can any of you tell me where i can discover young romeo ? 
i 'm spoiled . 
where are the evil men who began this fight ? 
then i mutiny against thee stars ! 
his syrups work quickly . 
i 'm biting my thumb . 
peter ! 
here comes my man , the man i 'm to seek . 
well , what was your dream ? 
thy mother is coming to your bedchamber . 
possess them ! 
go there and compare her vantage to some other girls i 'll show you . 
ay , i know her age down to the hour . 
will you would not , then ? 
o wife , behold how our daughter bleeds ! 
romeo is coming . 
it 's already almost night . 
give me that pickax and the crowbar . 
o lord , they 're fighting ! 
my employer is as good as yours . 
come , come away .
