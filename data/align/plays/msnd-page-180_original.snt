If we shadows have offended,  Think but this, and all is mended—  That you have but slumbered here  While these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,  No more yielding but a dream,  Gentles, do not reprehend.
If you pardon, we will mend.
And, as I am an honest Puck,  If we have unearnèd luck  Now to ’scape the serpent’s tongue,  We will make amends ere long.
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands if we be friends,  And Robin shall restore amends.
