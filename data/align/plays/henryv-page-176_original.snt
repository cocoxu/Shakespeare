The sun doth gild our armor.
Up, my lords.
O brave spirit!
Now, my Lord Constable?
Hark how our steeds for present service neigh.
Mount them and make incision in their hides, That their hot blood may spin in English eyes And dout them with superfluous courage.
Ha!
What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
How shall we then behold their natural tears?
