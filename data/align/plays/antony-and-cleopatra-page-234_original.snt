Ho, ho, ho!
Now the witch take me if I meant it thus!
Grace grow where those drops fall!
My hearty friends, You take me in too dolorous a sense, For I spake to you for your comfort, did desire you To burn this night with torches.
Know, my hearts, I hope well of tomorrow, and will lead you Where rather I’ll expect victorious life Than death and honor.
Let’s to supper, come, And drown consideration.
