If thou speak’st false, Upon the next tree shall thou hang alive Till famine cling thee.
If thy speech be sooth, I care not if thou dost for me as much.
I pull in resolution and begin To doubt th' equivocation of the fiend That lies like truth.
Fear not, till Birnam wood Do come to Dunsinane”; and now a wood Comes toward Dunsinane.—Arm, arm, and out!— If this which he avouches does appear, There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
I 'gin to be aweary of the sun, And wish th' estate o' th' world were now undone.— Ring the alarum-bell!—Blow, wind!
Come, wrack!
At least we’ll die with harness on our back.
