Here, father, take the shadow of this tree For your good host.
Pray that the right may thrive.
If ever I return to you again, I’ll bring you comfort.
Grace go with you, sir.
Away, old man.
Give me thy hand.
Away!
King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en.
Give me thy hand.
Come on.
No further, sir.
A man may rot even here.
What, in ill thoughts again?
Men must endure Their going hence even as their coming hither.
Ripeness is all.
Come on.
And that’s true too.
