You have prevailed.
I will depart in quiet And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
I know a wench of excellent discourse, Pretty and witty, wild and yet, too, gentle.
There will we dine.
This woman that I mean, My wife—but, I protest, without desert— Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal; To her will we to dinner.
And fetch the chain; by this I know ’tis made.
Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine, For there’s the house.
That chain will I bestow— Be it for nothing but to spite my wife— Upon mine hostess there.
Good sir, make haste.
Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me, I’ll knock elsewhere, to see if they’ll disdain me.
I’ll meet you at that place some hour hence.
Do so.
This jest shall cost me some expense.
