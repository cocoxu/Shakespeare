Damn you, you villain, you rascal!
What’s the matter, lieutenant?
To think that fool had the nerve to try to teach me manners!
I’ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave!
You’ll beat me?
Are you talking, you villain?
No, don’t hit him, lieutenant!
Please, sir, restrain yourself.
Let me go, or I’ll knock you on the head.
Come on, you’re drunk.
Drunk?
No, lieutenant—God, gentlemen—Help—Lieutenant—sir, Montano—Help, men!—The night guard is coming!
Who’s sounding that alarm?
The whole town will riot!
God, lieutenant, please stop!
You’ll be ashamed of this forever!
What is the matter here?
My God, I’m bleeding!
I’ve been mortally wounded.
I’ll kill him!
Stop right now!
Stop!
Lieutenant—sir, Montano—gentlemen!
Have you forgotten your duty and your sense of decorum?
Stop!
The general is talking to you!
Stop, for God’s sake!
How did this all start?
Have we all become as savage as the Turks, treating each other as badly as they would have treated us?
For heaven’s sake, stop this savage brawl!
The next man who swings his sword must not care about his life, because the instant he strikes, he dies.
Stop that alarm from ringing, it’s scaring the islanders.
What’s the matter here, gentlemen?—Honest Iago, you look upset.
Speak up and tell me who started this.
Answer me.
I don’t know.
We were all having fun until just a minute ago; we were as happy as a bride and groom taking off their clothes.
But then the mood suddenly changed.
It was as if something had driven the men insane and made them point their swords at one another.
I don’t
know what could have started this.
I’d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this!
How did you manage to lose your self-control like this, Michael?
Please, excuse me, sir.
I can’t speak.
Montano, you’re supposed to be calm and collected.
You’re famous for it.
Wise people respect you.
What in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler?
Tell me.
Othello, I’ve been seriously hurt.
Your officer Iago can tell you what happened.
I should save my breath, since it hurts to talk.
I didn’t do anything wrong that I know of, unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me.
All right, now I’m starting to lose my cool.
By God, if you don’t tell me what happened you’ll all suffer.
Tell me how this fight began, who started it.
Whoever is guilty, even if he were my twin brother, I swear I’m through with him.
We’re in a town that’s just
avoided a war, everyone’s still on edge, and you’re getting into private fights while you’re supposed to be on guard duty?
That’s unbelievably bad.
Iago, who started it?
I know you’re close to Cassio, but if you diverge from the truth in any way, you’re not a true soldier.
You’re hitting close to home there.
I’d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about Michael Cassio.
But I don’t think it’ll hurt him to tell the truth.
This is what happened, General.
Montano and I were talking when a man came running, crying for help.
Cassio was chasing him with his sword out, trying to kill the guy.
This gentleman stopped Cassio and told him to put away his sword.
I followed the guy who was crying for help, to keep him from scaring the public.
But he was fast and outran me.
When I got back, I heard the swords clinking and Cassio swearing.
I’d never heard him swear before.
They were nearly killing each other, as you saw when you pulled them apart.
I can’t tell you anything else.
But nobody’s perfect, and even the best man sometimes loses control and strikes out in rage.
Cassio was wrong to hurt Montano, who was only trying to help him, but I’m sure the guy who ran away must have offended Cassio in some terrible way, and Cassio couldn’t let it pass.
Iago, I know you’re fond of Cassio and are downplaying this for his benefit.
Cassio, I love you, but you’re never again going to be one of my officers.— Look, you’ve woken my wife!
I’ll make you an example for the others to learn from.
What’s the matter, dear?
Everything’s fine, now, sweetheart.
Go back to bed.—  Iago, go and calm down the townspeople.—Come with me, Desdemona.
Unfortunately, it’s part of the soldier’s life to be woken up by trouble.
Are you hurt, lieutenant?
Yes, but no doctor can help me.
Oh I hope that’s not true!
You know I’m powerful enough to make you pay for this.
Please wait, sir.
Why are you talking about robbery?
This is Venice.
My house isn’t in some remote countryside.
Brabantio, with all due respect, I’m here out of courtesy and good will.
I’ve come to tell you— My God, sir, you’re stubborn and suspicious.
We come here to help you and you treat us like thugs, but you let an African horse climb all over your daughter.
Your grandsons will neigh to you like horses.
Your whole family will be ruined.
What kind of crude jerk are you?
The kind that tells you that the Moor is having sex with your daughter right now.
You’re a villain!
You’re a senator!
You’re going to pay for this, Roderigo.
I know who you are.
I’ll answer for everything.
I don’t know if you know or approve of this, but in the wee hours of the morning your daughter left your house, with no better escort than a hired gondolier, to go into the rough embrace of a lustful Moor.
If all of this happened with your
My reputation, my reputation!
I’ve lost my reputation, the longest-living and truest part of myself!
Everything else in me is just animal-like.
Oh, my reputation, Iago, my reputation!
I swear I thought you meant you’d been hurt physically.
Your physical health matters more than your reputation.
A reputation is a useless and fake quality that others impose on us.
You haven’t lost it unless you think you have.
There are lots of ways to get on the general’s good side again.
You’ve been discharged because he’s angry, and because he’s obliged to do so for policy reasons, not because he dislikes you.
He’s got to beat up the weak to frighten the strong.
Go to him, petition him.
He’ll change his mind.
I’d rather ask him to hate me than ask such a good commander to accept such a worthless, drunk, stupid officer as myself.
Drunk?
Babbling senselessly?
Squabbling?
Swaggering?
Swearing?
Ranting and raving to my own shadow!
Oh, wine is the devil!
Who were you chasing with your sword?
What did he do to you?
I don’t know.
Is that possible?
I remember a jumble of impressions, but nothing distinctly.
I remember a fight, but not why we were fighting.
Oh God, why do men drink and lose their minds?
Why do we party until we’re like animals?
You seem all right now.
How did you get better?
My drunkenness went away when anger took over.
One weakness led to another, to make me hate myself.
Come on, you’re being too hard on yourself.
I wish none of this had happened, given the situation here, and your rank.
But since this has happened, you should fix it for your own good.
I’ll ask him for my position back again, and he’ll tell me I’m a drunk.
Even if I had a whole bunch of mouths, I wouldn’t be able to answer that.
I was a reasonable man, then I became a fool, and finally a beast!
Oh, how strange!
Every glass of liquor is damned, and the devil’s the main ingredient!
Come on now, wine is good for you, if you know how to use it.
Don’t say anything bad about wine anymore.
Lieutenant, I think you know I’m your friend.
I know that, sir.
Imagine, me, a drunk!
Any man can get drunk sometime.
I’ll tell you what to do.
Othello’s wife has a lot of influence now.
He’s completely devoted to her.
Go open your heart to her.
Ask her to help you get back your position.
She is so generous, kind, and ready to help that she thinks it’s wrong not to do everything she can, even more than she is asked to do.
Ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you.
I’d bet my lucky stars your problem will be forgotten, and your relationship will be stronger than ever.
That’s good advice.
I’m helping you because I like and respect you.
I believe it completely.
Early in the morning I’ll go visit Desdemona and plead my case.
My situation is desperate.
You’re doing the right thing.
Good night, lieutenant.
I’ve got to go to the guard tower.
Good night, honest Iago.
Who can say I’m evil when my advice is so good?
That’s really the best way to win the Moor back again.
It’s easy to get Desdemona on your side.
She’s full of good intentions.
And the Moor loves her so much he would renounce his Christianity to keep her happy.
He’s so enslaved by love that she can make him do whatever she wants.
How am I evil to advise Cassio to do exactly what’ll do him good?
That’s the kind of argument you’d expect from Satan!
When devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces, just like I’m doing now.
And while this fool is begging Desdemona to help him, and while she’s pleading his case to the Moor, I’ll poison the Moor’s ear against her, hinting that she’s taking Cassio’s side because of her lust for him.
The more she
tries to help Cassio, the more she’ll shake Othello’s confidence in her.
And that’s how I’ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all.
Hello, Roderigo!
I’m totally worn out.
My chase is too much for me.
I’ve spent most of my money, and tonight I got beaten up.
The upshot is that I’ve got a little more experience.
So with no money, but a little more wisdom, I’m going back to Venice.
You’re a poor man if you’re this impatient!
If you get hurt, does your wound heal immediately?
No, it heals gradually.
We achieve things with our intelligence, not by magic, and intelligent planning takes time.
Aren’t things going well?
Cassio’s beaten you up, but with that tiny sacrifice on your part, you got Cassio discharged!
If we’re patient, we’ll be rewarded with the fruits of our labors.
My God, it’s morning.
All this excitement has made the time fly by.
Go back to where you’re staying and go to sleep.
Go on, I’m telling you.
You’ll understand better later.
Go.
Now two things still need to be done.
My wife has to help make Desdemona take Cassio’s side.
I’ll put her on that.
And I need to take the Moor aside right at the moment when Cassio’s talking to Desdemona, so he’ll see them together.
Yes, that’s the way I’ll do it.
Let’s not ruin a brilliant plan by being slow to act.
Musicians, start playing here.
I’ll pay you for your trouble.
Play something short that will put the general in a good mood.
Your instruments all have a nasal twang.
Have they been to  Excuse me?
Are these wind instruments?
Yes, they are.
Oh, there’s the problem.
What’s the problem?
Anyone full of hot air is a problem.
But here’s some money.
The general likes your music a lot, but he asks you to stop playing now.
Well, we’ll stop, then.
If you’ve got any music that can’t be heard, then play that.
But as I said, the general isn’t really in the mood to hear music now.
We don’t have any music that can’t be heard.
Then pack up your instruments and go away.
Go!
Do you hear, my friend?
No, I don’t hear your friend.
I hear you.
Please don’t play games.
CASSIO  She’s awake, sir.
If she feels like coming over here, I’ll give her your message.
Good to see you, Iago.
You didn’t go to sleep, then?
No.
When I left you it was already morning.
I’ve been bold, Iago.
I’ve asked to talk to your wife.
I’m going to ask her to let me talk to Desdemona.
I’ll send her out to you now.
I’ll think of a plan to get the Moor out of the way, so you can speak more openly.
I humbly thank you.
Even for a  Good morning, lieutenant.
I’m sorry about what happened, but I’m sure everything will turn out all right.
The general and his wife are talking about it now, and she’s defending you strongly.
The Moor says the man you hurt is very important in Cyprus, and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you.
But he says he still loves and respects you, and based on his own feelings alone he’s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back.
Please find a way to give me some time alone with Desdemona, if you think that’s all right.
Please come in.
I’ll take you to a place where you can speak freely.
Thank you very much.
Iago, give these letters to the ship’s captain who brought me here, and ask him to pay my respects to the Senate of Venice.
Now that’s done, I’m going to walk on the fortification walls.
Look for me there when you come back.
I will, my lord.
Shall we go see this fortification, men?
We’re at your service, my lord.
I’ll do everything I can for you, Cassio.
Please do, madam.
My husband’s so upset about Cassio’s problem you’d think it was his own.
Your husband’s such a good man.
Don’t worry, Cassio.
I’m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before.
My dear beautiful lady, whatever happens to Michael Cassio, he’ll always be your humble servant.
I know that.
Thank you.
You’re my husband’s friend and you’ve known him a long time.
I assure you the only reason he’s keeping away from you now is political.
Yes, my lady.
But those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service, especially if I’m gone and someone else has my job.
That’ll never happen.
Emilia here will be my witness: I promise you that you’ll get your position back again.
And if I promise to help someone, I do everything I can.
My husband will never get a moment’s rest, I’ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
approval, then we’ve been very rude to bother you like this.
But if you didn’t know about it, then you were wrong to get mad at us.
I’d never play pranks on you.
If you didn’t allow your daughter to do what she’s doing, then she’s rebelling against you.
She’s throwing her life away on some stranger.
Go ahead, see for yourself if she’s in her bedroom.
If she is, you can sue me for lying to you.
Light the candles!
Wake up my whole household!
I dreamt about this.
I’m starting to worry it’s true.
Give me some light!
It’s time for me to say goodbye to you.
It would be inappropriate—dangerous, even—for me to be seen working against the Moor, as I would if I stayed.
The Venetian government might reprimand him for this, but it can’t safely get rid of him, since it needs him urgently for the imminent Cyprus wars.
They couldn’t find another man with his abilities to lead their armed forces—not if their souls depended on it.
I hate him, but I’ve got to show him signs of loyalty
of patience.
He will think that his bed has become a conference table for discussing your problem—he won’t be able to get away from it.
I’ll bring up your name at every moment.
So cheer up.
I’m your advocate, and I’d rather die than give up on you.
Madam, here comes your husband.
Madam, I’d better leave now.
Why not stay and hear me talk to him?
No, madam.
I’m very uncomfortable, and that won’t help my case.
Well, do whatever you think best.
Hey!
I don’t like that.
What did you say?
Nothing, my lord, or if I did—I don’t know what.
Wasn’t that Cassio leaving my wife?
Cassio, my lord?
No, I don’t think so.
He wouldn’t sneak away looking so guilty when he saw you coming.
I really think it was him.
What’s this, my lord?
I was talking to a petitioner here just now, someone who’s suffering from your anger.
Who do you mean?
Your lieutenant, Cassio.
Oh, if I’ve got any influence over you at all, please patch things up with him.
In my judgment, this man truly loves you, and his mistake was innocent rather than wicked.
Please call him and tell him to come back here.
Was that him just now?
Yes.
He feels so bad and humble that I feel bad along with him.
My love, call him back in here.
Not now, my sweet Desdemona.
Some other time.
But will it be soon?
Very soon, because you want it.
Will it be tonight at supper?
No, not tonight.
Then tomorrow at dinner?
I won’t be eating dinner at home.
I’ll be meeting the captains at the citadel.
Well then, tomorrow night, or Tuesday morning.
Or Tuesday noon or at night, or Wednesday morning.
Please just name a time, but don’t wait more than three days.
He’s very sorry.
His mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place—though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers.
So when should he come?
Tell me, Othello.
I can’t imagine you asking me for something and me telling you no or standing there muttering.
Michael Cassio came with you when you were trying to win my love.
Sometimes I’d criticize you to him, and he’d defend you.
And now I have to make this big fuss about bringing him back?
I swear, I could do so much— Please, no more.
He can come whenever he wants.
I won’t refuse you anything.
Don’t act like you’re doing me a favor!
This is like if I asked you to wear your gloves when it’s cold outside, or eat nutritious food, or do something that’s good for you.
If I ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test, it’ll be something difficult and terrible.
I won’t deny you anything!
But in return, please, do one thing for me: leave me alone for a little while.
Would I ever deny you anything?
No.
Goodbye, my husband.
Goodbye, my Desdemona.
I’ll come see you right away.
Come here, Emilia.—Do whatever you feel like doing, my husband, and I’ll obey you.
What a wonderful girl!
God help me, I love you!
And when I stop loving you, the universe will fall back into the chaos that was there when time began.
My noble lord— What is it, Iago?
When you were wooing Desdemona, did Michael Cassio know about it?
Yes, he knew about it the whole time.
Why do you ask?
I was just curious.
No reason.
Why are you curious, Iago?
I didn’t realize he knew her.
Oh, yes.
He carried messages back and forth between us very often.
Oh, really?
Oh, really?
Yes, really.
Do you see something wrong with that?
Isn’t he an honest man?
Honest, my lord?
Honest, yes, honest.
As far as I know, sir.
What are you thinking?
Thinking, my lord?
Thinking, my lord?” My God, you keep repeating everything I say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud.
You’re thinking something.
Just a minute ago I heard you say you didn’t like it when Cassio left my wife.
What didn’t you like?
And when I told you he was involved the whole time I was trying to get Desdemona, you were like, “Oh, really?” And then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible.
If you’re my friend, tell me what you’re thinking.
My lord, you know I’m your friend.
I think you are.
And I know you’re full of love and honesty, and you think carefully before you speak.
That’s why these pauses of yours frighten me.
If some fool were withholding things from me, I wouldn’t think twice about it.
If some lying, cheating villain acted like that, it would just be a trick.
But when an honest man acts like that, you know he’s wrestling with bad thoughts and can’t help it.
As for Michael Cassio, I think it would be safe for me to swear that he’s honest.
I think so too.
People should be what they appear to be.
If they’re not honest, they shouldn’t look like they are!
Absolutely, people should be what they appear to be.
In that case, I think Cassio’s an honest man.
No, I think there’s more to this than you’re letting on.
Please tell me what you’re thinking—even your worst suspicions.
Please don’t make me do that, sir.
I have to obey all your orders, but surely I’m not obligated to reveal my deepest thoughts—even slaves aren’t expected to do that.
You want me to say what I’m thinking?
What if my thoughts are disgusting and wrong?
Even good people think horrible things sometimes.
Who is so pure that they never think a bad thought?
You’re not being a good friend, Iago, if you even  Please don’t ask me to tell you.
I might be completely wrong.
I have a bad tendency to be suspicious of people and to look too closely into what they’re doing.
Often I imagine crimes that aren’t really there.
You would be wise to ignore my weak guesses and imaginary suspicions, and don’t worry yourself about the meaningless things I’ve noticed.
For me to tell you my thoughts would only destroy your peace of mind, and
it wouldn’t be wise, honest, or responsible for me to tell them.
What are you talking about?
A good reputation is the most valuable thing we have—men and women alike.
If you steal my money, you’re just stealing trash.
It’s something, it’s nothing: it’s yours, it’s mine, and it’ll belong to thousands more.
But if you steal my reputation, you’re robbing me of something that doesn’t make you richer, but makes me much poorer.
I’m going to find out what you’re thinking.
You can’t find that out, even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn’t make me tell you.
And as long my heart’s inside my body, you never will.
What?
Beware of jealousy, my lord!
It’s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours.
The man who knows his wife is cheating on him is happy, because at least he isn’t friends with the man she’s sleeping with.
But think of the unhappiness of a man who worships his wife, yet doubts her faithfulness.
He suspects her, but still loves her.
Oh, what misery!
The person who’s poor and contented is rich enough.
But infinite riches are nothing to someone who’s always afraid he’ll be poor.
God, help us not be jealous!
Why are you telling me this?
Do you think I would live a life of jealousy, tormented by new suspicions every hour?
No.
If there’s any doubt, there is no doubt.
I might as well be a goat if I ever let myself become obsessed with the kind of suspicions you’re implying.
If you say my wife is beautiful, eats well, loves good company, speaks freely, sings, plays music, and dances well, you’re not making me jealous.
When a woman is virtuous, talents like these just make her better.
And I’m not going to start feeling inferior.
She had her eyes wide open when she chose me.
No, Iago, I’ll have to see some real evidence before I start suspecting her of anything bad, and when I suspect her, I’ll look for proof, and if there’s proof, that’s when I’ll let go of my love and my jealousy.
I’m glad to hear you say that.
Now I can show you my devotion and my duty with more honesty.
So please listen to me.
I’m not talking about proof yet.
Watch your wife.
Watch how she is with Cassio.
Just watch—don’t be either completely suspicious or completely trustful.
I wouldn’t want to see you taken advantage of because you’re such an open and trusting guy.
Watch out!
I know the people of Venice well.
They let God see things they wouldn’t show their husbands.
They don’t avoid doing things that are wrong, they just try not to get caught.
Do you really think so?
She lied to her father to marry you.
And when she pretended to be afraid of you, she loved you the most.
That’s right, she did.
Well, there you go.
She was so young, but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft!
But I’m sorry I’ve blurted all this out.
I beg your pardon for loving you too much.
I’m indebted to you forever.
You seem a little depressed about this.
Not at all, not at all.
Really, I’m afraid you are.
I hope you remember that I said all this because I love you.
But I see you’re troubled.
Please don’t take what I said more seriously than it deserves to be taken.
I won’t.
If you take it too seriously, it’ll have bad effects that I didn’t want it to have.
Cassio’s a good friend of mine—My lord, I can see you’re upset.
No, not too upset.
I’m sure Desdemona would never cheat on me.
I hope she never does!
And I hope you keep on thinking she wouldn’t.
But still, it’s true that good things can go bad, away from their true natures— That’s the point I’m trying to make.
If I can be frank with you, she veered away from her own nature in turning down all those young men from her own country, with her skin color, with her status—everything her nature would have drawn her to—Ugh!
You can almost smell the dark and ugly desires inside her, the unnatural thoughts—But—I’m sorry—I didn’t mean to refer to her specifically just now.
I only worry that she might snap back to her natural taste in men one day, and compare you unfavorably to other Italians.
Goodbye, goodbye.
If you see anything else, let me know.
Tell your wife to watch her.
Leave me alone now, Iago.
My lord, I’ll say goodbye now.     
and affection, even if it’s just an act.
If you want to find him, send the search party to the Sagittarius Inn.
He and I will be there.
It’s true.
She’s gone.
The rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness.
Now, Roderigo, where did you see her?—Oh, that miserable wretch!—You say you saw her with the Moor?—Oh, who would want to be a father?—How did you know it was her?—To think she tricked me so easily!—What did she say to you?—Get me more candles, and wake up all my relatives.
Do you think they’re married?
Yes, I really think so.
Oh, heaven, how did she get out?
My own flesh and blood rebels against me!
Fathers, never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent.
Are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray?
Have you ever heard of anything like that, Roderigo?
Yes, sir, I have.
Call my brother.—Now I wish you’d married her!—Some of you go one way, some the other way.—Do you know where we can find her and the Moor?
I think I can find him.
Get together a group of armed men and follow me.
giving it back to him.
That will tell you a lot.
But in the meantime, just assume that I’m paranoid—as I’m pretty sure I am—and keep thinking she’s innocent, please.
Don’t worry about how I handle it.
I’ll say goodbye once more.
This Iago is extremely honest and good, and he knows a lot about human behavior.
If it turns out that she really is running around on me, I’ll send her away, even though it’ll break my heart.
Maybe because I’m black, and I don’t have nice manners like courtiers do, or because I’m getting old—but that’s not much—She’s gone, and I’ve been cheated on.
I have no choice but to hate her.
Oh what a curse marriage is!
We think our beautiful wives belong to us, but their desires are free!
I’d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone I love, sharing the rest of her with others.
This is the plague of important men—our wives betray us more than those of poor men.
It’s our destiny, like death.
We are destined to be betrayed when we are born.
Oh, here she comes.
If she’s cheated on me, then heaven itself is a fake.
I don’t believe it.
What’s going on, Othello, darling?
The nobles of Cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you.
I’m sorry.
Why are you whispering?
Are you sick?
I have a  That’s from lack of sleep.
It’ll go away.
Let me wrap up your head, and it will feel okay in less than an hour.
No, your handkerchief’s too little.
Leave my head alone.
Come on, I’ll escort you to dinner.
I’m very sorry you’re not feeling well.  
hundred times.
But she loves it so much (since Othello told her she should always keep it with her) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it.
I’ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to Iago.
Heaven knows what he’s going to do with it.
I only try to satisfy his whims.
What’s going on?
What are you doing here alone?
Don’t snap at me.
I’ve got something for you.
You’ve got something for me?
It’s a common  What?
to have a stupid wife.
Oh, is that so?
And what would you give me for the handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
What handkerchief?
The one the Moor gave to Desdemona, which you asked me to steal so many times.
You stole it from her?
No, actually.
She dropped it carelessly, and, seizing the opportunity, since I was here, I picked it up.
Look, here it is.
Good girl, give it to me.
And what are you going to do with it?
Why did you want it so much that you begged me to steal it?
What’s it to you?
If you don’t need it for some important reason, then give it back to me.
Poor lady, she’ll go crazy when she sees it’s missing.
Don’t admit to knowing anything about it.
I need it.
Now go, leave me.
I’ll leave this handkerchief at Cassio’s house and let him find it.To a jealous man, a meaningless little thing like this looks like absolute proof.
This handkerchief may be useful to me.
The Moor’s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions.
Ideas can be like poisons.
At first they hardly even taste bad, but once they get into your blood they start burning like hot lava.
Here he comes.
No drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night.
Argh!
She’s cheating on me?
Oh, general, please, no more of that!
Get lost!
You’ve tortured me with these thoughts.
It is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little.
What’s with you, my lord?
I had no idea she was cheating on me.
I never saw it or suspected it, so it never hurt me.
I slept well, ate well, and was happy.
I never saw Cassio’s kisses on her lips.
A man who’s robbed, but doesn’t miss what’s stolen, isn’t robbed at all.
I’m sorry to hear this.
I would’ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her, the lowest-ranking grunts and all, as long as I didn’t know anything about it.
Oh, goodbye to my peace of mind!
Goodbye to my happiness!
Goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great!
Goodbye!
Goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums, the flute and the splendid banners, and all those proud displays and pageantry of war!
And you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods, goodbye!
Othello’s career is over.
Is this possible, my lord?
You villain, you’d better be able to prove my wife’s a whore!
Be sure of it.
Get me proof I can see.
If you can’t, trust me, you won’t want to feel my rage!
Has it come to this?
Show me, or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt.
If you can’t, your life is worthless!
My noble lord— If you’re slandering her just to torture me, then it’ll be no use to pray for mercy or say you’re sorry.
You might as well go ahead and commit every unspeakable crime you can think of, because there’s nothing you could that would top what you’ve already done!
Oh, heaven help me!
Aren’t you a rational human being?
Don’t you have any sense at all?
Goodbye.
I resign my official position.
I’m such an idiot for always telling the truth!
What a horrible world we live in!
Listen, pay attention, everybody.
It’s not safe to be straightforward and honest.
I’m glad you’ve taught me this valuable lesson.
From now on, I’ll never try to help a friend when it hurts him so much to hear the truth.
No, stop.
You should always be honest.
I should always be wise.
Honesty’s stupid, it makes me lose my friends even when I’m trying to help them.
I swear, I think my wife’s faithful, and I think she’s not.
I think you’re trustworthy one minute and then not the next.
I need proof!
Her reputation was as pure as the snow, but now it’s as dirty and black as my own face.
As long as there are 
I see you’re all eaten up with emotion.
I’m sorry I said anything.
You want proof?
Want?
Yes, I want it, and I’ll get it.
But how?
How will you get proof?
Are you going to hide and watch them having sex?
Death and damnation!
Oh!
I think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched.
If anyone sees them in bed together besides themselves, I guess we could damn them then.
So what can we do?
What can I say?
What proof is there?
It’d be impossible for you to watch them, even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks.
But if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof, we can get that.
Give me one good reason to think she’s cheating on me.
I don’t like what you’re asking me to do.
But since I’ve gotten myself involved this far, because I’m so stupidly honest and because I like you so much, I’ll keep going.
I recently shared a bed with Cassio, and I couldn’t sleep because of a raging toothache.
Well, some people talk in their sleep, and Cassio is one of them.
I heard him saying, “Sweet Desdemona, let’s be careful and hide our love,” in his sleep.
And then he grabbed my hand and said, “Oh, my darling!” and
kissed me hard, as if he were trying to suck my lips off.
Then he put his leg over mine, and sighed and kissed me, and said, “Damn fate for giving you to the Moor!” Oh, that’s monstrous!
Monstrous!
No, it was just a dream.
But it shows that something has already happened.
It’s a reason for suspicion, even though it’s just a dream.
And it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy.
I’ll tear her to pieces!
No, be reasonable.
We don’t have any proof yet.
She might still be faithful.
Just tell me this: have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it?
Yes, I gave her one like that.
It was my first gift to her.
I don’t know about that, but I saw a handkerchief like that today.
I’m sure it belongs to your wife, and I saw Cassio use it to wipe his beard.
If it’s the same one— If it’s the same one, or any one that belongs to her, then together with the other evidence it’s pretty strong.
Oh, I’d kill that bastard Cassio forty thousand times if I could!
Killing him once is not enough revenge.
Now I see it’s true.
Oh, Iago, all the love I felt is gone, vanished in the wind.
Welcome, hatred and vengeance!
Get out of my heart, love!
My heart feels like it’s full of poisonous snakes!
Calm down— I want blood!
Be patient, I’m telling you.
You may change your mind later.
Never, Iago.
My thoughts of revenge are flowing through me like a violent river, never turning back to love, only flowing toward full revenge that’ll swallow them up.
I swear to God I’ll get revenge.
Don’t get up yet.
Let heaven be my witness—I’m putting my mind, my heart, and my hands in Othello’s control.
Let him command me, and I’ll do whatever he asks, no matter how violent.
I accept your devotion with my deepest love.
I’ll put you to the test right away.
Within the next three days I want to hear you tell me that Cassio’s dead.
My friend Cassio is dead.
It’s done, because you request it.
But let her live.
Damn her, the wicked whore!
Oh, damn her, damn her!
Come away with me.
I’m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil.
You’re my lieutenant now.
I’m yours forever.
Lead the way.
I’ll stop at every house.
I’m respected enough that most of them will do what I say.—Get your weapons!
And get the officers who guard the city at night.—Let’s go, Roderigo.
I’ll reward you for your troubles.
Excuse me, do you know which room Lieutenant Cassio  I wouldn’t dare say he lies anywhere.
Why do you say that?
He’s a soldier.
If I accused a soldier of lying, he’d stab me.
Oh, come on.
Where does he sleep?
Telling you where he’s sleeping is like telling you where I’m lying.
What on earth does that mean?
I don’t know where he’s staying, so if I told you he’s sleeping here or there, I’d be lying.
Can you ask around and find out?
I’ll go ask questions everywhere.
Find him and tell him to come here.
Tell him I’ve spoken to my husband on his behalf, and I think everything will be all right.
I think I can do that.
It’s not too much to ask.
Where could I have lost that handkerchief, Emilia?
I don’t know, madam.
Believe me, I’d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins.
This would be enough to make my husband suspect me, if he wasn’t so free of jealousy.
He’s not jealous?
Who, him?
I think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land.
Look, here he comes.
I won’t leave him alone until he gives Cassio his job back.—How are you, my lord?
I’m fine, my lady.— I’m fine, my lord.
Give me your  It’s moist because it’s still young and inexperienced.
It says you’re fertile, and you’ve got a giving heart.
Hot, hot and moist.
With a hand like this you need to
fast and pray to stave off temptations.
Someone with a young sweating hand like this one is bound to act up sooner or later.
It’s a nice hand, an open one.
You’re right to say that.
This was the hand that gave you my heart.
This hand gives itself away very freely.
In the old days, people used to give their hearts to each other when they joined their hands in marriage.
But these days, people give each other their hands without their hearts.
I don’t know about that.
Now, don’t forget, you promised me something.
What did I promise, my dear?
I sent for Cassio to come talk with you.
I have a bad cold that’s bothering me.
Lend me your handkerchief.
Here, my lord.
No, the one I gave you.
I don’t have it with me.
You don’t?
No, my lord.
That’s not good.
An Egyptian woman gave that handkerchief to my mother.
She was a witch, and she could
almost read people’s thoughts.
She told my mother that as long as she kept it with her, my father would love and desire her.
But if she lost it or gave it away, my father would start hating her and looking at other women.
When she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when I got married.
I did.
So pay attention.
Treat it as something precious.
Losing it or giving it away would be an unspeakable loss, a loss like none other.
Is that possible?
Yes, it’s true.
There’s magic in its fabric.
A two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance.
The silk came from sacred silkworms, and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins' hearts.
Really?
Is that true?
It’s absolutely true, so take good care of it.
I wish I had never seen it!
Ha!
Why?
Why are you yelling at me so angrily?
Is it lost?
Is it gone?
Tell me, is it missing?
God help me!
What do you have to say for yourself?
It’s not lost, but what if it were?
What do you mean?
I’m telling you, it’s not lost.
Then bring it here.
Let me see it.
I could, sir.
But I don’t want to now.
This is just a trick to take my mind off what I’m asking you for.
Please hire Cassio again.
Bring me the handkerchief—My mind is full of doubt.
Come on.
You know you’ll never find a more capable man.
The handkerchief!
He’s counted on your friendship for his success.
He’s shared dangers with you— The handkerchief!
Really, I don’t think you’re behaving very well.
Damn it!
And you say he’s not jealous?
I never saw him like this before.
There must be some magic in that handkerchief.
I’m miserable that I lost it.
Men are all the same, but it takes longer than a year or two to see how bad they are.
They’re like stomachs and we’re just the food.
They eat us up hungrily, and when they’re full, they vomit us up.
Look, here comes Cassio and my husband.
There’s no other way.
She’s the one who’s got to do it.
And what luck, she’s here!
Go ahead and ask her.
Hello, Cassio.
How are you?
Nothing, madam.
Just my earlier request.
I’m begging you to help me get back on his good side.
I’m devoted to him with all my heart.
I can’t wait any longer.
If my wrongdoing was so serious that I can’t get back into his good graces either by my past service, or my present situation, or the promise of devoted service in the future, just knowing that would help me.
Then I could stop wondering, and find some other career.
I’m sorry, dear Cassio, but now is not the right time to bring up your case.
My husband’s not himself.
If his face changed as much as his personality has, I wouldn’t recognize him.
God knows I have done my best to argue for you, and made him angry at me for being so aggressive.
You’ll just have to be patient for a little while.
I’ll do what I can, more than I’d do for myself.
Let that be enough for you.
Is Othello angry?
He just left, clearly upset about something.
Can he even get angry?
It’s hard to believe.
I’ve seen him stay calm when cannons were blowing his soldiers to bits, even killing his own brother without him batting an eyelid—is he really upset?
It must be about something important.
I’ll go talk to him.
If he’s angry, there must be something seriously wrong.
Please, do so.
There must be some political news from Venice, or some dangerous plot here in Cyprus has ruined his good mood.
Men always get angry about little things when they’re really worried about bigger ones.
That’s the way it goes.
When our finger hurts, it makes the rest of the body hurt too.
We shouldn’t expect men to be perfect, or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday.
Oh, Emilia, I’m so inexperienced that I thought he was being unkind, but actually I was judging him harshly.
I hope to God it’s something political, like you think, and not jealousy involving you.
Oh no!
I never gave him reason to be jealous.
But jealous people don’t think like that.
They’re never jealous for a reason; they’re just jealous.
It’s like a monster that just grows and grows, out of nothing.
I hope God keeps that monster from growing in Othello’s mind!
Amen to that, lady.
I’ll go look for him—Cassio, stay around here.
If he’s in a good mood I’ll mention you again, and do everything I can.
I thank you, lady.
Hello, Cassio!
Why are you so far from home?
How are you, my pretty Bianca?
To tell you the truth, I was just going to your house.
And I was just going to yours.
You’ve kept away from me for a week?
Seven days and seven nights?
A hundred and sixty-eight hours?
And lovers' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones!
What a tedious wait!
I’m sorry, Bianca.
All this time I’ve been depressed and had problems on my mind.
When I get some free time I’ll make it up to you.
Oh, Cassio, where did you get this?
This is a gift from another woman, a new lover!
Now I know why you’ve been staying away from me.
Has it come to this?
Well, well.
Oh, come on, woman.
Stop jumping to silly conclusions.
Now you’re jealous, thinking that this is from some mistress of mine, but I swear it’s not, Bianca.
Well, whose is it?
I don’t even know.
I found it in my room.
It’s pretty.
Someone is certainly looking for it, and I’ll have to give it back.
So I’d like it copied.
Take it and do that for me, and leave me alone for a while.
Leave you alone!
Why?
I’m waiting here for the general, and I don’t want him to see me with a woman.
And why’s that?
It’s not because I don’t love you.
But you don’t love me.
Please, just walk with me a little ways, and tell me if I’ll see you later tonight.
I can only walk a little way with you, since I’m waiting here.
But I’ll see you soon.
All right, have it your way.
I have to make do.
I’ve killed many men in battle, but I still believe it’s deeply wrong to murder someone.
Sometimes I worry I’m not cruel enough for this job.
Nine or ten times I wanted to stab him under the ribs.
It’s better that you didn’t kill him.
But he kept chattering so foolishly, talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms, that it was hard for me to restrain myself.
But please tell me, sir, is your marriage  Let him do his worst.
The services I have done for the Venetian government will count for more than his complaints will.
No one knows this yet—and I don’t like to brag, but I come from a royal family, and I’m as noble as the woman I’ve married.
And let me tell you, Iago, if I didn’t love Desdemona as much as I do, I’d never agree to get married and lose my freedom at all.
But look at those lights.
Who’s coming?
Do you really think so?
What do you mean, do I think so?
What, just because they kissed in private?
An illicit kiss!
Maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so, but they didn’t do anything.
Naked in bed together, but without doing anything?
Come on, Iago.
That would be like playing a trick on the devil: they’d make him think they’re going to commit adultery, but then back off.
Anyone who acted like that would be letting the devil tempt them, and tempting God to condemn them.
As long as they didn’t do anything, it would only be a minor sin.
But if I gave my wife a handkerchief— Then what?
Then it’s hers.
And if it’s hers, I guess she can give it to any man she wants.
Her reputation is also her own.
Can she give that away too?
You can’t see a reputation.
A lot of people don’t even deserve the reputations they have.
But a handkerchief— God, I wish I could forget about the handkerchief!
What you told me it haunts me like a nightmare—he’s got my handkerchief!
Yes, what about it?
That’s not good.
What if I’d said I saw him do something to hurt you?
Or heard him say something about it.
You know there are jerks out there who have to brag about bedding some woman.— Has he said anything?
Yes, but he’d deny it all.
What did he say?
He said he did—I don’t know.
He what?
He was in bed with— With her?
With her, on top of her—however you want to say it.
In bed with her?
On top of her?
I would have thought people were telling lies about her rather than believe he was lying on her.
My God, it’s nauseating!
Handkerchief—confessions—handkerchief!
I’ll kill him first, and then let him confess—I’m trembling with rage.
I wouldn’t be trembling like this if I didn’t know deep down this was all true.
Noses, ears, lips.
Is it possible?
Tell me the truth—Handkerchief—Damn it!
Keep working, poison!
This is the way to trick gullible fools.
Many good and innocent women are punished for reasons like this.—My lord?
My lord, Othello!
Hey, Cassio!
What’s the matter?
Othello’s having some kind of epileptic fit.
This is his second fit like this.
He had one yesterday.
Rub his temples.
No, don’t.
This fit has to run its course.
If you interrupt it, he’ll foam at the mouth and go crazy.
Look, he’s moving.
Why don’t you go away for a bit?
He’ll get
better right away.
When he leaves, it’s very important that I talk to you.
What happened, general?
Did you hit your head?
Are you making fun of me?
Making fun of you?
No, I swear!
I wish you could face your bad news like a man!
A man who’s been cheated on isn’t a real man.
He’s subhuman, like an animal.
In that case there are a lot of animals on the loose in this city.
Did he confess?
Sir, be a man.
Every married man has been cheated on.
Millions of men sleep with wives who cheat on them, wrongly believing they belong to them alone.
Your case is better than that.
At least you’re not ignorant.
The worst thing of all is to kiss your wife thinking she’s innocent, when in fact she’s a whore.
No, I’d rather know the truth.
Then I’ll know exactly what she is, just as I know what I am.
You’re wise!
That’s for sure.
Go somewhere else for a while.
Calm down.
While you were dazed by grief—which isn’t appropriate for a man like you—Cassio showed up here.
I got him to leave, and made up an excuse for your trance.
I told him to come back and talk to me in a bit, and he promised he would.
So hide here and watch how he sneers
at you.
I’ll make him tell me the whole story again—where, how often, how long ago—and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future.
I’m telling you, just watch his face.
But stay calm, and don’t get carried away by rage, or I’ll think you’re not a man.
Do you hear what I’m saying, Iago?
I’ll be very patient, but—do you hear me?—I’m not done with him yet That’s fine, but for now keep your cool.
Will you go hide?
Now I’ll ask Cassio about Bianca, a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes.
She’s crazy about Cassio.
That’s the whore’s curse, to seduce many men, but to be seduced by one.
Whenever he talks about her he can’t stop laughing.
And when he laughs, Othello will go crazy.
In his ignorant jealousy, he’ll totally misunderstand Cassio’s smiles, gestures, and jokes.—How are you, lieutenant?
It doesn’t make me feel any better when you call me lieutenant.
I’m dying to have that title back again.
Just keep asking Desdemona, and it’ll be yours.
If it was up to Bianca to get you your job back, you’d have had it already!
The poor thing!
He’s laughing already!
I never knew a woman who loved a man so much.
The poor thing, I really think she loves me.
Now he denies it a bit, and tries to laugh it off.
Have you heard this, Cassio?
He’s asking him to tell the story again.
Go on, tell it.
She says you’re going to marry her.
Are you?
Ha, ha, ha!
Are you laughing because you’ve won?
Do you think you’ve won?
Me, marry her?
That whore?
Please give me a little credit!
I’m not that stupid.
Ha, ha, ha!
So, so, so, so!
The winner’s always got the last laugh, hasn’t he?
I swear, there’s a rumor going around that you’ll marry her.
You’re kidding!
If it’s not true, you can call me a villain.
Have you given me bastard children to raise?
All right, then.
The little monkey must have started that rumor herself.
She thinks I’ll marry her because she loves me.
She’s just flattering herself.
I never promised her anything.
Iago is gesturing for me to come closer.
Now he’s telling the story.
She was here just now.
She hangs around me all the time.
I was talking to some Venetians down by the shore, and the fool showed up.
I swear to you, she put her arms around me like this— Saying, “Oh, Cassio,” it seems, judging by his gestures.
She hangs around me and dangles from my neck and cries, shaking me and pulling at me.
Ha, ha, ha!
Now he’s saying how she took him into our bedroom.
Oh, I can see your nose now.
But I can’t see the dog I’m going to throw it to.
I have to get rid of her.
Look out, here she comes.
It’s a whore like all the others, stinking of cheap perfume.—Why are you always hanging around me?
Damn you!
What did you mean by giving me this handkerchief?
I was an idiot to take it!
You want me to copy the embroidery pattern?
That was a likely story, that you found it in your room and didn’t know who it belonged to.
This is a love token from some other slut, and you want me to copy its pattern for you?
Give it back to her, I won’t do anything with it.
What is it, my dear Bianca?
What’s wrong?
My God, that’s my handkerchief!
If you want to come have dinner with me, you can.
If you don’t want to, then good riddance.
Go after her, go.
Actually, I should.
She’ll scream in the streets if I don’t.
Will you be having dinner with her tonight?
Yes, I will.
Well, maybe I’ll see you there.
I’d really like to speak with you.
Please come.
Will you?
Don’t talk anymore, go after her.
Did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her?
Oh Iago!
And did you see the handkerchief?
Was it mine?
It was yours, I swear.
And do you see how much your foolish wife means to him?
She gave it to him, and he gave it to his whore.
I wish I could keep killing him for nine years straight.
Oh, she’s a fine woman!
A fair woman!
A sweet woman!
No, you have to forget all that now.
Yes, let her die and rot and go to hell tonight.
She won’t stay alive for long.
No, my heart’s turned to stone—when I hit it, it hurts my hand.
Oh, the world never saw a sweeter creature.
She could be married to an emperor, and he’d be like her slave!
But that’s not how you’re going to be.
Damn her, I’m just describing her truthfully!
She’s so good at sewing, and a wonderful musician.
Oh, she could sing a wild bear to sleep!
Oh, she’s so witty and creative!
All the worse that she stooped this low, then.
Oh, a thousand times worse, a thousand times—and what a sweet personality she has!
Yes, a little too sweet.
Yes, that’s for sure.
Oh, it’s dreadful, dreadful, Iago!
If you still feel so affectionate toward her, then why not give her permission to cheat on you?
If it doesn’t bother you, it won’t bother anyone else.
I’ll chop her into pieces.
How could she cheat on me?
Oh, it’s horrible of her.
And with my own officer!
That’s worse.
Get me some poison tonight, Iago.
I won’t argue with her, so her beautiful body won’t disarm me.—Tonight, Iago.
Don’t do it with poison.
Strangle her in her bed, the same bed she’s contaminated.
Good, good, I like that—it’s only fair!
Very good!
And let me kill Cassio.
You’ll hear more from me by midnight.
Excellent, good.
That’s her father and his friends, who’ve been roused out of bed.
You’d better go inside.
No, I must let them find me.
My good qualities, my legal status as Desdemona’s husband, and my innocence will protect me.
Is it them?
I don’t think so.
The servants of the Duke and my lieutenant?
Hello, everyone!
What’s going on?
The Duke sends his regards.
He needs to see you right away.
What do you think he wants?
Something about Cyprus.
I think it’s important.
The warships have sent a dozen messages tonight, one after the other, and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the Duke’s already.
They’re very anxious for you to get there.
When you weren’t at home, the Senate sent out three different search parties to find you.
It’s good you found me.
I’ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then I’ll go with you.
What’s that trumpet for?
I think someone’s coming from Venice.
It’s Lodovico.
He must be coming from the duke.
Look, your wife is with him.
Greetings, good general!
Greetings, sir.
The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
I’ll do whatever they order me to do in this letter.
What’s new, cousin Lodovico?
Very nice to see you, sir.
Welcome to Cyprus.
Thank you.
How is lieutenant Cassio?
Well, he’s alive.
Cousin, there’s been a falling out between him and Othello.
An unfortunate rift, but you can fix it.
Are you sure of that?
Excuse me?  
He didn’t say anything, he’s reading.
So there’s a rift between Othello and Cassio?
Yes, unfortunately.
I’d do anything to bring them back together, since I really care for Cassio.
Damn it all!
Excuse me, my lord?
Are you in your right mind?
Is he angry?
Maybe the letter upset him.
I think they want him to go home and appoint Cassio governor in his place.
I’m happy about that.
Oh, are you really!
My lord?
I’m glad you’re insane enough to admit it in front of me.
Why, sweet Othello—   I haven’t done anything to deserve this!
My lord, no one will believe this in Venice, even though I’d swear I saw it with my own eyes.
That was too much.
You should apologize.
She’s crying.
Oh, you devil, you devil!
You can cry all day and all night, and I still won’t believe you’re sad.
Get out of my sight!
I wouldn’t want to stay here and make you angry.
She’s obedient—a fine lady.
Please, my lord, call her back.
Madam!
My lord?
What do you want with her, sir?
Who, me?
Yes, you asked me to call her back.
See how well she can turn?
She can turn and turn, and then turn on you again.
And she can cry, sir—oh, how she can cry!
And she’s obedient, as you say, obedient.
Very obedient—keep crying.—Concerning this—oh, what fake emotion!—I am being ordered home—Get away from me, I’ll send for you later.—Sir, I’ll obey the order and return to Venice.
Get away from me, you witch!
Cassio can have my job.
And tonight, sir, I invite you have dinner with me.
Welcome to Cyprus.
Horny animals!
Is this the same Moor whom the senate considers so capable?
Is this the guy who’s supposed to never get emotional, and who never gets rattled, no matter what disaster happens?
He’s changed a great deal.
Is he sane?
Is he losing his mind?
He is what he is.
I won’t say anything negative about what he might be.
If he isn’t what he might be, then I wish to God he were!
Hitting his wife?
It’s true, that wasn’t such a nice thing to do.
But I wish I could say that’s the last time he’ll do it!
Is it a habit of his?
Or did the letter make him emotional somehow, and this is the first time he’s done it?
Oh, it’s too bad!
It wouldn’t be right for me to tell you everything I’ve seen and heard.
You’ll see what he’s like.
His own actions will show you what kind of person he is, so I won’t have to bother telling you.
Just go after him and watch what he does next.
I’m sorry I was so wrong about him.
You haven’t seen anything, then?
No, and I didn’t hear anything either, or suspect anything at all.
But you’ve seen her and Cassio together.
Yes, but I didn’t see anything wrong, and I heard every syllable they said.
Didn’t they ever whisper?
Never, my lord.
Or ask you to leave the room?
Never.
Not even to get her fan, or her gloves, or her mask, or anything?
No, my lord.
That’s strange.
I’d swear to you on my soul that she’s a good, honest person, sir.
If you suspect otherwise, stop thinking that right now because you’re wrong.
If any jerk has tried to convince you she’s bad, I hope God curses him.
If she’s not honest, faithful, and true, then there’s no such thing as a faithful wife or a happy husband.
Tell her to come here.
Go.
She says all the right things, but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story.
Desdemona’s a tricky whore with a closet full of awful secrets, but still she’ll kneel and pray like an honest woman.
I’ve seen her do it.
My lord, what do you want?
Please, dear, come here.
What can I do for you?
Let me see your eyes.
Look at my face.
What horrible thing are you imagining?
I’m begging you on my knees to tell me what your words mean.
I can tell you’re furious, but I don’t understand what you’re saying.
Why?
Who are you?
I’m your wife, your true and loyal wife.
Go ahead, swear to that, so you’ll be damned to hell for lying.
Otherwise the devils will mistake you for an angel and be too scared to grab you.
Go ahead, make sure you damn yourself by swearing you’ve been faithful to me.
Heaven knows I am.
Heaven knows you’re as unfaithful as hell.
Unfaithful, my lord?
With whom?
How am I unfaithful?
Leave me alone, Desdemona, go away!
Oh, what a horrible day!
Why are you crying?
Because of me?
If you’ve been ordered back to Venice because of my father, don’t blame me.
You may have lost his respect, but so have I.
If God had decided to treat me like Job, making me sick and covered with sores, reducing me to abject poverty, selling me into slavery and destroying all my hopes, I would have found some way to accept it with patience.
But instead He’s made me a laughingstock for everyone in our time to point at and scorn!
Even that I could put up with.
But instead, my wife, who’s supposed to
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from, has rejected me!
Worse than that, she’s polluted herself, so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce!
Even the goddess of patience couldn’t look at this and be patient—it’s too horrifying!
I hope you think I’m faithful to you.
As faithful as flies in rotting meat, which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows.
You’re like a weed pretending to be a flower, so beautiful and sweet-smelling that I ache when I look at you.
Oh, I wish you’d never been born!
Have I done something to offend you without knowing it?
Was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore?
What have you done?
What have you done?
Oh, you streetwalker!
If I said out loud what you’ve done, you’d burn up with shame.
What have you done?
Heaven has to hold its nose when it sees you!
The pure moon in the sky has to shut its eyes when you go by!
Even the wind that blows over everything on earth is ashamed to visit you.
You brazen whore!
I swear to God you’re accusing me wrongly!
So you’re saying you’re not a whore?
No, I’m as honest as I am Christian.
If only letting my husband touch my body means I’m not a whore, I’m not a whore.
What, you’re not a whore?
No, I swear it.
Is that possible?
Oh, heaven help us!
I beg your pardon then.
I must have the wrong woman.
I mistook you for that sly Venetian woman who married Othello.—You whorehouse-keeper.
You’re in charge of this hell!
You!
We’ve finished our business.
Here’s some money for you.
Please lock the door and keep quiet.
What’s he talking about?
How are you, madam?
I’m stunned, to tell you the truth.
My lady, what’s wrong with your husband?
Ensign, what’s he doing in there?
Tonight he boarded a treasure ship.
If he can keep it, he’ll be set forever.
I don’t understand.
He’s married.
To whom?
To— Are you ready?
Yes, I’ll go with you now.
Here comes another group looking for you.
It’s Brabantio.
Look out, sir.
He intends to do something bad to you.
Hey!
Stop right there!
Sir, it’s the Moor.
Get him, he’s a thief!
With who?
Why, with your husband, madam.
My lord.
Who’s your lord?
My lord is your lord.
I don’t have a lord.
Don’t talk to me, Emilia.
I can’t even cry, though tears are the only answers I could give to all your questions.
Tonight put my wedding sheets on my bed, and tell your husband to come to me now.
Things have certainly changed!
It’s fair for him to treat me like this, very fair.
What have I ever done that he has anything to complain about?
What can I do for you, madam?
How are you?
I don’t know.
When grown-ups teach little children, they do it gently and easily.
He might have treated me like that, because I’m as unused to abuse as a little child.
What’s the matter, lady?
He called her a whore so many times, and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can’t stand to hear it.
Am I that name, Iago?
What name, madam?
What my lord said I was.
He called her a whore.
A beggar couldn’t have called his slut worse names.
Why did he do that?
I don’t know.
I just know I’m not one.
Don’t cry, don’t cry.
What a day this is!
Did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen, give up her father and country and friends, just to be called a whore?
Doesn’t that make you want to cry?
It’s just my bad luck.
Damn him!
How did he get such an idea?
Heaven knows.
I bet my life some evil busybody, some meddling, lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position.
I bet my life on it.
Nobody’s that bad.
It’s impossible.
If there is, then heaven help him!
A hangman’s noose will help him!
Let hell chew him up!
Why should he call her a whore?
Who’s been with her?
When has she had the time, the place, or the means to sleep with anyone?
How is this at all likely?
The Moor is being tricked by some crook, some terrible villain, some rotten bastard.
Oh, I wish we could unmask scoundrels like that, and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with!
Keep your voice down.
Oh, to hell with those people!
It’s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect I’d cheated on you with the Moor.
You’re a fool.
Shut up.
Oh God, Iago, what can I do to win my husband back again?
Please go to him, my friend.
I swear I have no idea why he stopped loving me.
Here I’m kneeling to swear that if I ever did anything to destroy his love for me, either by thoughts or actions, or if I ever took pleasure in anyone else, or if I never did love him, or don’t love him now—even though he tries to shake me off—
then I hope I have a life of misery!
Unkindness is powerful, and his unkindness may kill me, but it’ll never destroy my love.
I can’t say “whore.” It makes me sick to say the word even now.
I wouldn’t do the thing that would make me a whore for all the money in the world.
Please calm down.
He’s just in a bad mood.
Political business is bothering him, and he’s just taking it out on you.
If only that were all it is— It is, I promise.
Those trumpets are calling us in to dinner.
The Venetians are waiting for their food.
Go in, and don’t cry.
Everything will be all right.
How are you, Roderigo?
I don’t think you’re treating me fairly.
What makes you say that?
Every day you put me off with some trick.
Instead of finding opportunities for me, you seem to be preventing me from making any progress.
Well, I won’t take it any longer.
And I’m not going to sit back and accept what you’ve done.
Will you listen to me, Roderigo?
I’ve listened to you too much already.
Your words and actions don’t match up.
That’s not fair.
It’s the truth.
I’ve got no money left.
The jewels you took from me to deliver to Desdemona would’ve made even a nun want to sleep with me.
You told me she got them, and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon, but nothing like that ever happens.
Well, all right then.
Fine.
Fine!” he says.
All right!” It’s not fine, and I’m not all right!
It’s wrong, and I’m starting to realize I’m being cheated!
Okay.
It’s not okay!
I’m going to tell Desdemona my feelings.
If she returns my jewels, I’ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her.
If not, I’ll challenge you to a duel.
You’ve said what you have to say now.
Yes, and I’ll do everything I just said.
Well, all right then.
Now I see that you have some guts.
From this moment on I have a higher opinion of you than before.
Give me your hand, Roderigo.
Your complaint against me is perfectly understandable, but I still insist I’ve done everything I could to help you.
It doesn’t look that way to me.
I admit it doesn’t look that way to me, and the fact that you suspect me shows that you’re smart.
But Roderigo, if you’re as courageous and determined as I think you are, then wait just a bit longer.
If you’re not having sex with Desdemona tomorrow night, then I suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me.
Well, what’s your plan?
Is it feasible?
Venice has made Cassio governor here on Cyprus.
Is that true?
Then Desdemona and Othello will go back to Venice.
Oh, no.
He’ll go to Mauritania and take the beautiful Desdemona with him, unless he gets stuck here for some reason.
The best way to extend his stay here is to get rid of Cassio.
What do you mean, get rid of him?
I mean knock his brains out, so he can’t take Othello’s place.
And that’s what you want me to do!
Yes, if you want to help yourself.
He’s having dinner tonight with a prostitute, and I’ll go visit him.
He doesn’t know he’s been appointed governor yet.
When you see him walking by here (as I’ll make sure he does between twelve and one) you can nab him.
I’ll be nearby to help you, and between the two of us we can handle him.
Come on, don’t stand there in a daze.
Come along with me.
I’ll give you such reasons for killing him that you’ll feel obliged to snuff him out.
It’s nearly dinner time, and the night’s going to be wasted.
Let’s go!
I want to hear more about this.
You will.
You’ll hear all you want to hear.
Please, sir, don’t trouble yourself.
I beg your pardon; walking will make me feel better.
Good night, madam.
Thank you.
You’re most welcome.
Would you walk out with me, sir?—Oh, Desdemona— Yes, my lord?
Go to bed right this minute.
I’ll be there shortly.
Send your maid Emilia away.
Make sure you do what I say.
I will, my lord.
How are things now?
He looks calmer than he did before.
He says he’ll come back right away.
He asked me to go to bed and to send you away.
Send me away?
That’s what he said.
So give me my nightgown, Emilia, and I’ll say goodnight.
We shouldn’t displease him.
Yes.
I wish you’d never met him.
That’s not what I wish.
I love him even when he’s harsh and mean—Help me unpin this, would you?—I love even his stubbornness, his frowns, his bad moods.
I put those wedding sheets on your bed, as you asked.
It doesn’t matter.
Oh, how silly we are!
If I die before you do make sure I’m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin.
Listen to you!
Don’t be silly!
My mother had a maid named Barbary.
She was in love, and her lover turned out to be wild and left her.
She knew an old song called “Willow” that reminded her of her own story, and she died singing it.
I can’t get that song out of my head tonight.
It’s all I can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor Barbary.
Please, hurry up.
Should I get your nightgown?
No, just help me unpin this.
That Lodovico is a good-looking man.
He’s very handsome.
He speaks well.
I know a lady in Venice who’d walk all the way to Palestine for a kiss from him.
No, that’s not how it goes.—Who’s knocking?
It’s the wind.
If I chase more women, you’ll sleep with more men—Okay, go away now.
Good night.
My eyes itch—is that an omen I’ll be crying soon?
No, it doesn’t mean anything.
I heard someone say that’s what it means.
Oh, these men, these men!
Do you honestly think—tell me, Emilia—there are women who’d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner?
There are women like that out there, no question.
You, Roderigo!
Come on, I’ll fight you.
Put away your swords.
They’ll get rusty in the dew.
Sir, your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do.
You evil thief, where have you hidden my daughter?
You devil, you’ve put a spell on her!
Anybody with eyes could tell you that a beautiful and happy young girl like her, who’s refused to marry all of the handsome young men of the city, wouldn’t run off with a black thing like you unless she’d been bewitched.
You’re something to fear, not to love.
It’s obvious to everyone that you’ve tricked her, drugged her, or kidnapped her.
That’s probably what happened, so I’m arresting you.—Arrest this man as a practitioner of black magic.
Grab him.
If he struggles, use force!
Just a minute.
I don’t need anyone to tell me when to fight.
You’ve accused me of some serious crimes.
Where do you want me to go to respond to these charges?
Would you ever do such a thing for all the world?
Why, wouldn’t you?
By the light of heaven, no, I would not!
I wouldn’t either, by daylight.
It would be easier to do it in the dark.
Could you really do such a thing, for all the world?
The world’s huge.
It’s a big prize for such a small sin.
I don’t think you would.
Actually I think I would, and then I’d undo it after I did it.
I wouldn’t do it for a nice ring, or fine linen, or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats.
But for the whole world?
Who wouldn’t cheat on her husband to make him king?
I’d risk my soul for that.
I’d never do such a bad thing, not for the whole world!
Why, a bad action is just a wrong in this world, but when you’ve won the whole world, it’s a wrong in your own world, so you can make it right then.
I don’t think any woman like that exists.
Yes, a dozen of them—as many as there are women in the world, in fact.
But I do think it’s the husband’s fault if we wives cheat on them.
For instance, our husbands
may stop sleeping with us, and give it out to other women instead.
Or they may get insanely jealous, and keep us from going anywhere.
Or let’s say they hit us, or cut back on the money they give us out of spite.
We have feelings.
We may be able to forgive them, but we want to get back at them too.
Husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too.
They see, smell, and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands.
Why do they replace us with other women?
Do they do it for fun?
I think they do.
Is it out of lust?
I think so.
Is it a weakness?
It is.
And don’t we have passions, and a taste for fun, and weaknesses, just like men?
Then tell them to treat us well.
Or let them figure out that the bad things we do are just what we learned from them.
Good night, good night.
I pray that God will let me learn from women like that—not to follow their bad example, but to avoid it!
Here, stand behind this wall; he’ll come right away.
Keep your sword out, and then stick it in as far as it’ll go.
Quick, quick.
Don’t be afraid.
I’ll be right next to you.
This will either make us or break us.
Keep that in mind, and be steady.
Stay right near me.
I may mess it up.
I’m right behind you.
Be bold, and get ready.
I don’t really want to do this, but he’s given me good reasons.
I guess it’s only one man—no big deal.
My sword comes out, and he dies.  
I know the sound of his walk.—Die, villain!
That thrust might really have hurt me if I didn’t have this armor on under my cloak.
Now let’s see what you’ve got on.
Oh, I’m dead!
I’ll be crippled forever!
Help!
Murder!
murder!
That’s Cassio’s voice.
Iago has kept his word.
Oh, what a villain I am!
That’s the truth.
Help me!
Get some light!
Get me a surgeon!
It’s him!
Brave Iago, how honest and trustworthy you are!
You even went as far as murder to help your friend in his misfortune.
You teach me how I should act.
Whore, your lover’s dead now, and you’ll be going to hell soon.
I’m coming, slut!
I’ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart.
You’ve already stained our sheets with your lust; now I’ll stain them with your whore’s blood.
Help!
Isn’t there a guard around?
No one passing by?
Murder!
Murder!
Something’s wrong, the man sounds panicked.
Oh, help!
Listen!
I’ve acted like such a villain!
Two or three men are groaning.
But it’s dark out, and it could be a trap.
It’s not safe to go near them till we get more help.
Nobody’s coming?
I’ll bleed to death.
Look!
Here’s someone coming in his pajamas, with a candle and weapons.
Who’s there?
Who’s shouting “murder”?
We don’t know.
Didn’t you hear someone shouting?
I’m here, here!
For heaven’s sake, help me!
What’s the matter?
It is.
He’s a good man.
Is that you, Iago?
I’m here, I’ve been destroyed by villains!
Help me.
Oh, lieutenant!
What villains did this to you?
I think one of them is nearby and can’t get away.
The treacherous criminals!— Somebody help me over here!
That’s one of them.  
Damned Iago!
You inhuman dog!
Killing men in the dark?
Where are these murderers?
This is such a quiet, sleepy town!—Murder, murder!—Who’s that coming?
Are you good or evil?
Judge for yourself.
Signor Lodovico?
That’s me.
I beg your pardon.
Cassio’s been wounded.
Cassio!
How are you doing, brother?
My leg’s been cut in two.
God forbid!
Bring me some light, gentlemen, I’ll bind the wound with my shirt.
What’s the matter?
Who’s shouting?
Who’s shouting?
Oh, my dear Cassio!
My sweet Cassio!
Oh, Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
You notorious whore!
Cassio, do you know who might have stabbed you like this?
No.
I’m sorry to find you like this.
I’ve been looking all over for you.
Lend me your sash—Oh, if we only had a stretcher to carry him out of here!
He’s fainted!
Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
Sir, I believe this piece of trash, Bianca, has something to do with all this trouble.—Hang in there, Cassio.—Come here, bring the light.
Do you recognize this face?
Oh, no, it’s my friend and countryman, Roderigo.—Yes, it’s Roderigo!
What, Roderigo from Venice?
That’s the one, sir.
Do you know him?
Know him?
Yes.
Signor Gratiano, I beg your pardon.
I didn’t mean to ignore you—it’s just because of this bloody uproar.
I’m glad to see you.
How are you doing, Cassio?—Someone bring me a stretcher!
Roderigo!
It’s him, it’s him.
Good—here’s the stretcher.
Get somebody strong to carry him out of here.
I’ll get the general’s surgeon.
There wasn’t any problem.
I don’t even know him.
Do you see how afraid she is?
Watch her, we’ll get the whole story.
Keep an eye on her.
Do you see?
The guilty speak volumes even when they’re silent.
What’s the matter?
What’s the matter, husband?
Cassio was attacked here in the dark by Roderigo and men who escaped.
He’s near death, and Roderigo’s dead already.
Oh, no, good gentleman!
Oh no, good Cassio!
This is what happens when you visit whores.
Please, Emilia, ask Cassio where he was at dinner tonight.—
He ate at my house, but that doesn’t make me nervous.
Oh, did he?
I order you to come with me.
Go to hell, you whore!
I’m no whore.
I’m as moral as you are.
As moral as me!
Damn you!
Gentlemen, let’s go make sure Cassio’s wounds are properly dressed.—Come on, ma'am, you can tell us another story.
Emilia, go to the castle and tell Othello and Desdemona what happened.—Will you please go now? 
To prison, until you’re called into court.
What if I do what you say?
How would I satisfy the Duke then?
His messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately, on pressing state business.
It’s true.
The Duke’s in a meeting right now, and he’s sent for you too.
The Duke’s in a meeting?
At this time of night?
Bring him with us.
The law’s on my side.
The Duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own.
If we let crimes like this happen, slaves and heathens will be our rulers.
I have to do it, I have to do it.
I have to keep my reason in mind.
I won’t say out loud what my reason is, but I have to do it.
But I won’t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin, whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble.
But she’s got to die, or she’ll cheat on other men.
Put out the light of the candle, and then put out the light of her heart.
If I extinguish the candle, I can light it again if I regret it.
But once I kill you, you beautiful, fake woman, I do not know the magic that could bring you back.
When I’ve plucked this rose, I can’t make it grow again; it will have no choice but to wither and die.
Let me smell you while you’re still on the tree.
Who’s there?
Othello?
Yes, Desdemona.
Will you come to bed, my lord?
Have you said your prayers tonight, Desdemona?
Yes, my lord.
If you can think of any crime you haven’t confessed, then pray for forgiveness right away.
Oh, my lord, what do you mean by that?
Well, hurry up and confess.
Be quick about it.
I’ll wait over here.
I don’t want to kill you before you’ve readied your soul.
No, I don’t want to send your soul to hell when I kill you.
You’re talking about killing?
Yes, I am.
Then heaven have mercy on me.
Amen to that, from the bottom of my heart.
If you really feel that way, then I hope you won’t kill me.
Hmmph!
You’re scaring me.
You terrify me when you have that look in your eyes.
I don’t know why I should be afraid, since I haven’t done anything wrong.
But I’m still afraid.
Think of your sins.
My only sin was loving you too much.
Yes, that’s why you have to die.
You’re wrong to kill me for loving you.
Why are you chewing on your lower lip like that?
You’re shaking with emotion.
These are bad omens, but I hope, I hope, they don’t predict my future.
Quiet.
Stay still.
I will.
What’s this all about?
You gave that handkerchief, the one I loved and gave to you, to Cassio.
No, I swear by my life and soul!
Bring him here and ask him.
My sweet darling, don’t lie.
You’re on your deathbed.
I am?
But I’m not dying yet!
Yes, right now.
So confess your sin freely now.
Even if you swear you’re innocent of every accusation, you won’t change my mind or remove the thought that’s tormenting me.
You’re going to die.
Then heaven have mercy on me!
Amen to that.
And you have mercy on me too!
I never did anything wrong to you in my life.
I never loved Cassio, except with the pure love that I feel for humankind.
I never gave him any token of romantic love.
I saw him holding the handkerchief!
You liar, you’re turning my heart to stone, and making me call what I’ll do murder, when I had been thinking of it as a sacrifice!
I saw the handkerchief.
He found it somewhere, then.
I never gave it to him.
Tell him to come here.
He’ll tell the truth.
He’s already done so.
What, my lord?
That he had sex with you.
What?
Had sex with me?
Yes.
He wouldn’t say that.
No.
He won’t say anything anymore.
Honest Iago’s arranged that.
Oh, I’m scared.
What, is he dead?
If he had as many lives as he’s got hairs on his head, I would’ve killed them all in revenge.
Oh, he’s been betrayed, and I’ve been ruined.
What, you whore, are you crying for him right in front of me?
Send me away, my lord, but don’t kill me!
Kill me tomorrow—but let me live tonight.
No, if you struggle with me— Just half an hour!
While I’m doing this, I can’t pause for a moment.
Just let me say one prayer!
It’s too late.
What’s that noise?
Aren’t you dead yet?
I know I’m cruel, but I’m merciful too.
I don’t want you to linger in pain.
Who’s there?  
Yes, it’s Emilia.
I’d forgotten about you—Emilia, wait a moment, let me draw the curtains.
What’s the matter with you now?
Oh, my lord, terrible murders have been committed over there!
What?
Just now?
Yes, just now, my lord.
It’s because of the full moon.
It comes too close to the earth and drives men crazy.
Cassio’s killed a young Venetian named Roderigo.
Roderigo’s been killed?
And Cassio’s killed?
No, Cassio wasn’t killed.
Cassio’s not dead?
Then the wrong man is dead, and sweet revenge has gone wrong.
Oh, I’ve been murdered unfairly!
Oh Lord, who’s that crying?
That?
What?
Oh, no, that was my lady’s voice.
Help!
Help!
Oh, lady, speak again.
Sweet Desdemona!
Oh sweet mistress, speak!
I’m dying an innocent woman.
Oh, who did this thing?
No one.
I did it myself.
Give my love to my kind husband.
Oh, goodbye!
Why, how could she have been murdered?
My God, who knows?
You heard her say it wasn’t me.
Yes, she said that.
I must go report what happened.
She was lying even as she was going down to hell.
I did kill her.
Then she was even more an angel, and you’re an even blacker devil!
She cheated on me, and she was a whore.
You slander her, you devil.
She was fickle and unfaithful, like water.
You’ve lost your mind to accuse her of cheating.
She was utterly true to you!
Cassio had sex with her.
Ask your husband if you doubt me.
If I didn’t have a good reason to do this, damn me to the very bottom of hell.
Your husband knew about everything.
My husband!
Your husband.
He said she was unfaithful?
Yes, with Cassio.
If she’d been faithful to me, I never would have given her up, not even if God himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her.
My husband.
Yes, he’s the one who first told me about her.
He’s an honest man who detests evil actions.
My husband?
Why do you keep repeating that, woman?
I’m telling you, your husband.
Oh, my mistress, a villain has made a mockery of your love!
My husband said she was unfaithful!
Yes, him, woman.
I said “your husband.”—Do you understand that word?
My friend, your husband, the honest, honest Iago.
If he said that, then I hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever.
He’s lying through his teeth!
She was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that!
Ha!
Go ahead, do your worst.
Killing me won’t send you to heaven.
You weren’t good enough for her.
You’d better shut up!
I can endure far more pain than you could ever give me!
Oh, you idiot!
You stupid fool!
As dumb as dirt!
You’ve committed a terrible evil—I’m not afraid of your sword.
I’ll tell everyone what you did, even if it
costs me my life twenty times over.—Help, help, help!
The Moor’s killed my mistress!
Murder, murder!
What’s the matter?
What’s going on here, general?
Oh, are you here, Iago?
You’ve done a good job, that other men can attribute their murders to you!
What’s the matter?
I told him what I thought.
I didn’t tell him anything that didn’t make sense or ring true to him.
But did you tell him she cheated on him?
I did.
Then you told a lie, a sick, wicked lie.
I swear on my soul it was a lie.
You said she slept with Cassio.
Did you say Cassio?
Yes, with Cassio.
Now be quiet.
I will not be quiet!
I have to speak.
My mistress here lies murdered in her bed— No, heaven forbid!
These reports are inconsistent.
You can’t trust them.
It’s true, they’re inconsistent.
My letters say there are a hundred and seven ships.
And mine say a hundred and forty.
And mine say two hundred.
But often in these cases, reports are just estimates.
The important thing is that they all say a Turkish fleet is approaching Cyprus.
Yes, we get the idea.
The inconsistency doesn’t make me think that the reports are all wrong.
I have no doubt about what they’re basically saying, and it’s frightening.
It’s a messenger from the warships.
Why are you here?
Signor Angelo told me to come here and tell you that the Turkish fleet is heading for Rhodes, not Cyprus.
And your lies caused this murder.
Don’t stand there gaping, everyone.
It’s true.
It may be true, but it’s unbelievable.
Oh, what a horrible deed!
Evil, evil, evil!
I can smell it!
I suspected it earlier.
I’ll kill myself out of grief!
Oh, evil, evil!
Are you crazy?
I’m ordering you, go home.
Good gentlemen, give me permission to speak.
I know I ought to obey my husband, but not now.
Maybe I’ll never go home again, Iago!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Yes, go ahead and moan, because you killed the sweetest, most innocent woman who ever lived!
She was filthy!
I barely knew you, Uncle  Poor Desdemona!
I’m glad your father isn’t alive to see this.
Your marriage made him die of grief before his time.
If he was alive now, this sight would hurt
him terribly.
It would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell.
It’s sad, but Iago knows she had sex with Cassio a thousand times.
Cassio confessed it, and she pledged her love to him by giving him the handkerchief I’d given her.
I saw it in his hand.
It was an old memento that my father gave to my mother.
Oh, God!
Dear God in heaven!
Damn it, shut your mouth.
No, the truth will come out—Me, shut my mouth?
Let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up.
I’ll say what I have to say.
If you’re smart, you’ll go home.
I won’t.
Shame on you!
Drawing your sword on a woman?
Oh, you stupid Moor!
I found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband.
He’d begged me to steal it many times.
You evil whore!
You think she gave it to Cassio?
No, I found it and gave it to my husband.
You piece of filth, you’re lying!
I swear I’m not lying.
Won’t heaven strike this Iago dead?
You absolute villain!
The woman’s falling down!
He’s killed his wife!
Yes, yes!
Lay me next to my mistress.
He’s gone, and his wife’s dead.
He’s a wicked, horrible criminal.
Take the Moor’s sword and guard the door from the outside.
Kill him rather than let him leave this room.
I’m going after Iago.
He’s a horrid criminal.
I’m not that strong, if a puny nobody can grab my sword.
But why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did?
Let it all go.
What did your song mean, lady?
Can you hear me?
I’ll die like a swan.
They sing when they die.
Moor, she never cheated on you.
She loved you, you cruel man.
I swear on my soul I’m telling the truth, and as I say this, I die.
I’ve got another weapon in the room.
It’s a Spanish sword, hardened in ice cold water and razor sharp.
Here it is.
Uncle, I’m coming out!
Look in on me, and talk with me, or I’ll attack even without a weapon.
What’s the matter?
Look, I have a weapon, the best sword a soldier could have.
I’ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon.
But
who can control his fate?
I’m not like that now.
Don’t be afraid, even though you see me with a weapon.
This is the end of my journey, the end of my life.
Are you backing away in fear?
There’s no reason to be afraid.
You could tap me with a feather and I’d back away.
Where would Othello go?—Oh, look at you!
Such cruel luck!
You’re as pale as your nightgown!
When we meet on Judgment Day, that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell, where devils will grab me.
You’re cold, cold, and you were never hot with lust.
Oh you damned villain!
Whip me, you devils, so I don’t have to look at this heavenly sight!
Blow on me with hot winds, roast me in lava, drown me in liquid fire!
Oh, Desdemona!
Dead Desdemona!
Oh, oh!
Where is that poor rash man?
You mean the man who used to be Othello?
Here I am.
Where’s that snake?
Bring the villain forward.
Come on, don’t tell me that.
I don’t like it that you knew about this, Iago.
All this time I’ve thought you were such a good friend that I’ve let you spend my money as if it was yours.
Damn it, you’re not listening to me!
I never dreamed this was happening—if you find out I did, you can go ahead and hate me.
You told me you hated him.
I do hate 
I’m looking to see if you have cloven hooves like the devil.
But that’s just a fairy tale.
If you are a devil, I won’t be able to kill you.
Take his sword away from him.
I’m bleeding, but you didn’t kill me.
I’m not sorry, either.
I want you to live, since to me, death is happiness.
Oh Othello, you were once so good, then you were tricked by this villain.
What can I say to you?
Say anything.
Call me an honorable murderer if you like.
I did nothing out of hate, only out of honor.
This poor guy’s partly confessed his plan.
Did you plan Cassio’s death with him?
Yes.
Dear general, I never gave you any reason to hate me.
I believe you, and I ask you to forgive me.
Will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul?
Don’t ask me anything.
You know what you know.
From this moment on, I’ll never say another word.
What, not even to pray?
Torture will make you talk.
Well, do your best.
Sir, you’ll understand everything that has happened.
I don’t think you know now.
Here is a letter we found in Roderigo’s pocket.
And here’s another.
This one talks about how Roderigo should kill Cassio.
Oh, you villain!
Ungodly and monstrous!
Here’s another letter from his pocket, addressed to Iago and full of complaints.
We think he was going to send it to Iago, but then Iago stepped in and answered his complaints by killing him.
Oh, you wicked scoundrel!
Cassio, how did you get my wife’s handkerchief?
I found it in my room, and Iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes.
Oh, what a fool I am!
Also, in his letter to Iago, Roderigo criticizes Iago for telling him to get me angry while I was on guard duty, and get me demoted.
And just now he admitted it, even though he’d seemed to be dead for a long while—Iago tricked him, Iago urged him to do it.
You’ll have to leave this room and come with us.
You’re stripped of your power and your command, and Cassio will govern Cyprus.
As for this slave, Iago, if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time, he’ll have it.
You’ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the Venetian government.—Okay, take him away.
Wait.
A word or two before you go.
I’ve given the state of Venice a bit of help in the past, and they know it.
But enough about that.
When you record these sad events in your letters, please describe me exactly as I am.
Don’t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility.
If you’re being fair, you’ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much, but who wasn’t wise about it.
I was not easily made jealous, but once I was tricked and manipulated, I worked myself into a frenzy.
Describe me as a fool who threw away a precious pearl with his own hands, like a silly Indian who didn’t know what it was worth.
As someone who was not emotional, but who then cried a lot.
Write all this
down, and then say also that in Aleppo I once saw a Turk beating a Venetian, so I grabbed the Turk by the throat and hit him like this.
Oh, what a bloody end to all this!
Everything we’ve heard is bad.
I was afraid this would happen, because he was a noble, brave man, but I didn’t think he had a weapon.  
What do you think about this change?
They can’t have changed; there’s no way this could be true.
It’s a trick to confuse us.
Think about how important Cyprus is to the Turks, and remember that they could capture Cyprus more easily, since it isn’t as well protected as Rhodes is.
If we keep these things in mind, we can’t possibly imagine that the Turks would be so incompetent as to put off for last what they want to achieve first, setting aside something easy and profitable to do something dangerous and pointless.
No, I think we can be confident that the Turks aren’t really headed for Rhodes.
Here’s some more news coming in.
Sir, the Turks sailed to Rhodes, where they joined with another fleet.
That’s just what I thought.
How many, can you guess?
Thirty ships.
Now they’ve turned around and are clearly heading for Cyprus.
Signor Montano, your brave and loyal servant, gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him.
Then it’s certain they’re heading for Cyprus.
Is Marcus Luccicos in town?
No, he’s in Florence.
Write to him immediately.
Hurry.
Here come Brabantio and the brave Moor.
Brave Othello, I have to send you right away to fight the Turks, our great enemy.— I could have used yours as well.
Forgive me, your grace.
I didn’t get out of bed and come here in the dead of night because I heard about the war or because I was worried about the city’s defense.
I have a personal problem so painful and gut-wrenching that it overwhelms everything else.
Why, what’s the matter?
It’s my daughter!
Oh, my daughter!
Is she dead?
She’s dead to me.
She’s been tricked and stolen from me, enchanted by black magic spells.
She must’ve
been tricked or drugged, because there’s no way she could have made this mistake on her own.
Whoever tricked your daughter and stole her from you will pay for it.
And you yourself will determine the sentence as you see fit, and impose the death penalty if you choose to, even if the criminal were my own son.
I humbly thank you, sir.
Here is the man, the Moor.
It seems you had your own reasons for summoning him here.
We’re sorry to hear this.
Nothing, but this is true.
Noble, honorable gentlemen whom I serve: it’s true that I’ve taken this man’s daughter from him and married her.
But that’s my only offense.
There’s nothing more.
I’m awkward in my speech and I’m not a smooth talker.
From the time I was seven years old until nine months ago I’ve been fighting in battles.
I don’t know much about the world apart from fighting.
So I won’t do myself much good by speaking in my own defense.
But if you’ll let me, I’ll tell you the plain
story of how we fell in love, and what drugs, charms, spells, and powerful magic—because that’s what I’m being accused of—I used to win his daughter.
She’s a good girl, quiet and obedient.
She blushes at the slightest thing.
And you want me to believe that despite her young age and proper upbringing she fell in love with a man she’d be afraid to look at?
The very thought of it is ridiculous.
You’d have to be stupid to think that someone so perfect could make such an unnatural mistake as that.
The devil must be behind this.
Therefore I say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her.
Your saying this isn’t proof.
There has to be clear evidence that he’s done this, not just these accusations.
Tell us, Othello.
Did you trick or deceive this lady in some way?
Or did you agree to this as equals?
Please, send for Desdemona to come here from the Sagittarius Inn and ask her to speak about me in front
of her father.
If she has anything bad to say about me, then you can sentence me to death.
Bring Desdemona here.
Iago, bring Desdemona here.
You know where she is.
In the meantime I’ll tell you all, as honestly as I confess my sins to God, how I wooed this beautiful lady, and how she came to love me.
Tell us, Othello.
Her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often, continually asking me about my life and all the battles I’ve fought.
I told him everything, from my boyhood up until the time when I was talking to him.
I told him about unfortunate disasters, hair-raising adventures on sea and on land, and near-catastrophes and dangerous adventures I’ve been through.
I told him how I was captured and sold as a slave, how I bought my freedom, and how I wandered through caves and deserts.
I was able to tell him about cannibals who eat each other, and men with heads growing below their shoulders.
When I talked about all these things, Desdemona used to listen attentively.
If she had to go do some household chore, I noticed that she’d always come back quickly to hear more of my stories.
When I was relaxing, she’d pull me aside and ask to hear some part of a story she had missed.
Her eyes would fill with tears at the bad things I went through in my younger years.
When my stories were done, she’d sigh and tell me how strangely wonderful and sad my life had been.
She said she wished she hadn’t heard it, but she also wished there was a man like me for her.
She thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell, she’d fall in love with him.
I took the hint and spoke to her.
She said she loved me for the dangers I’d survived, and I loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me.
That’s the only witchcraft I ever used.
Here comes my wife now.
She’ll confirm everything.
I think a story like that would win my own daughter over.
Brabantio, I urge you to make the best of this.
Try to accept what’s happened.
Please let her speak.
If she admits she wanted this, then I won’t blame Othello.—Come here, my child.
Who do you obey here?
Father, this isn’t easy for me.
I’m torn.
I owe you respect because you gave me life and education.
You’re the one I have to obey.
I’m your daughter.
But this man here is my husband now, and I owe him as much as my mother owed you, just as she preferred you to her own father.
So I have to give my obedience to the Moor, my husband.
I’m finished, then.
Duke, please go ahead with your state business.
I’d rather adopt a child than have one of my own.—Come here, Moor.
I’m forced to give my blessing to this marriage.
With all my heart, I give you that thing which, if you didn’t already have it, I’d try with all my heart to keep from you.
Desdemona, I’m glad you’re my only child, since if I had others I’d keep them all locked up.
You would have made me treat them like a tyrant.—I’m done, my lord.
Let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers: if you can’t change something, don’t cry about it.
When you lament something bad that’s already happened, you’re setting yourself up for more
bad news.
A robbery victim who can smile about his losses is superior to the thief who robbed him, but if he cries he’s just wasting time.
So if the Turks steal Cyprus from us, it won’t be bad as long as we keep smiling.
It’s easy to accept platitudes like that if you haven’t lost anything.
But I’ve lost something precious, and I have to put up with the platitude as well as suffering my loss.
Talk is cheap.
I’ve never heard of someone feeling better because of someone else’s words.
Please, I’m asking you, go ahead and get back to your state affairs.
The Turks are heading for Cyprus with a powerful fleet.
Othello, you understand better than anyone how the defenses for Cyprus work.
Even though we have a very good officer in charge there already, everyone says you’re the better man for the job.
So I’ll have to ask you to put a damper on your marriage celebrations and take part in this dangerous expedition.
I’ve gotten used to the hardships of a military life.
I rise to the occasion when faced with difficulties.
I will take charge of this war against the Turks.
But I humbly ask you to make appropriate arrangements for my wife,
giving her a place to live and people to keep her company that suit her high rank.
She can stay at her father’s house.
I won’t allow it.
Neither will I.
And I wouldn’t stay there.
I don’t want to upset my father by being in his house.
Dear Duke, please listen to what I have to say.
What do you want to do, Desdemona?
When I fell in love with Othello I made up my mind that I wanted to live with him.
You can see how much I wanted to be with him by how violently I threw away my old life.
I feel like I’m a part of him now, and that means I’m part of a soldier.
I saw Othello’s true face when I saw his mind.
I gave my whole life to him because of his honor and bravery.
If I were left at home uselessly while he went off to war, then I’m separated from my husband in his natural element.
I’d be miserable without him.
Let me go with him.
Please allow her to do this.
I’m not asking to have her near me for sex—I’m too old for that, and my sexual
urges are dead.
I want this because she wants it—I love her for her mind.
And I’d never want you to think that I’d neglect my serious official duties while she was there with me.
If I ever let love blind me so that I choose to lounge around in bed with my loved one instead of going off to war, then you can let a housewife use my helmet as a frying pan.
My reputation would be disgraced if I ever acted like that.
You can decide that privately.
I don’t care whether she stays or goes.
What’s important is the urgency of this mission.
You’ve got to act fast.
You’ll have to leave tonight.
With all my heart, I’ll go right away.
We’ll meet again at nine in the morning.
Othello, have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you.
My lord, my ensign is an honest and trustworthy man.
He’ll accompany my wife, and bring whatever else you think I might need.
which any peace-lover can do.
His military understanding is all theory, no practice.
But Cassio’s been chosen over me.
My career is cut short by some bookkeeper, even though the general saw my fighting skills first-hand in Rhodes and Cyprus.
This accountant is now lieutenant, while I end up as the  By God, I’d rather be his executioner.
And there’s nothing I can do about it.
That’s the curse of military service.
You get promoted when someone likes you, not because you’re next in line.
Now, you tell me: should I feel loyal to the Moor?
If you don’t like him you should quit.
No, calm down.
I’m serving under him to take advantage of him.
We can’t all be masters, and not all masters should be followed.
Look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food, and then when they get old they’re terminated.
They ought to be whipped for being so stupid.
But then there’s another kind of servant who looks dutiful and devoted, but who’s really looking out for himself.
By pretending to serve their lords, these men get rich, and when they’ve saved up enough they can be their own masters.
Guys like that have soul, and that’s the kind of guy I am.
Let me tell
All right, then.
Good night, everyone.— Goodbye, black Moor.
Treat Desdemona well.
Keep an eye on her, Moor.
She lied to me, and she may lie to you.
I’d bet my life she’d never lie to me.
Iago, I’m leaving my dear Desdemona with you.
Have your wife attend to her, and bring them along as soon as you can.
Come on, Desdemona, I’ve only got an hour of love to spend with you, to tell you what you need to do.
We’re on a tight schedule.
Iago.
What do you have to say, noble friend?
What do you think I should do?
Go to bed, and sleep.
I’m going to go drown myself.
If you do that, I’ll never respect you again.
Why, you silly man!
It’s silly to live when life is torture.
The only cure is death.
Oh, how stupid!
I’ve been alive for twenty-eight years, and I’ve never met a man who knew what was good for him.
I’d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman I can’t have.
What should I do?
I know it’s foolish to be so much in love, but I can’t help it.
Can’t help it?
Nonsense!
What we are is up to us.
Our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener.
Depending on what we plant—weeds or lettuce, or one kind of herb rather than a variety, the garden will either be barren and useless, or rich and productive.
If we didn’t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires, our bodily urges would take over.
We’d end up in ridiculous situations.
Thankfully, we have reason to cool our raging lusts.
In my opinion, what you call love is just an offshoot of lust.
I don’t believe it.
You feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower.
Come on, be a man.
Drown yourself?
Drowning is for cats or blind puppies—don’t drown yourself!
I’ve told you I’m your friend, and I’ll stick by you. 
I’ve never been more useful to you than I will be now.
Here’s what you’ll do.
Sell all your assets and your land, and turn it into cash.
Desdemona can’t continue loving the Moor any more than he can continue loving her.
She fell in love with him very suddenly, and they’ll break up just as suddenly.
Moors are moody people.—So sell your lands and raise a lot of cash.
What seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter.
She’ll dump Othello for a younger man.
When she’s had enough of the Moor’s body, she’ll realize her mistake.
She’ll need to have a new lover.
She’ll have to have it.
So have your money ready.
If you want to go to hell, there are better ways to do it than killing yourself.
Raise all the money you can.
I can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved Venetian girl.
You’ll get to sleep with her—just put together some money.
And to hell with drowning yourself!
That’s completely beside the point.
If you’re ready to die, you can risk death by committing crimes in an attempt to get the woman you want.
Don’t just give up on her and drown yourself.
Can I count on you if I wait to see what happens?
You can trust me.
Go now and get cash.
I told you before, and I’ll tell you again and again: I hate the Moor.
I’m devoted to my cause of hating him, just as devoted as you are to yours.
So let’s join forces and get revenge.
If you seduce Desdemona and make a fool out of him, it’ll be fun for both of us.
Many things may happen.
Go get money.
We’ll speak again tomorrow.
Goodbye.
Where will we meet in the morning?
At my house.
I’ll be there early.
Go home.
Goodbye.
Oh, and one more thing— What is it?
No more talk about killing yourself, okay?
I’ve changed my mind about that.
Go then, goodbye.
Put a lot of cash together.
I’m going to sell all my land.
That’s how I always do it, getting money from fools.
I’d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if I couldn’t get something useful out of him.
I hate the Moor, and there’s a widespread rumor that he’s slept with my wife.
I’m not sure it’s true, but just the suspicion is enough for me.
He thinks highly of me.
That’ll help.
Cassio’s a handsome man.
Let’s see, how can I
get his position and use him to hurt Othello at the same time?
How?
How?
Let’s see.
After a while I’ll start telling Othello that Cassio is too intimate with Desdemona.
Cassio is a smooth talker and a good-looking guy, the sort of man that people would expect to be a seducer.
The Moor is open and straightforward.
He thinks any man who seems honest is honest.
People like that are easy to manipulate.
So it’s all decided.
I’ve worked it out.
With a little help from the devil, I’ll bring this monstrous plan to success.
What can you see out on the ocean?
Nothing.
The water’s so rough that I can’t see any sails, either in the bay or on the ocean.
It was windy on shore too.
A big blast of wind shook our fortifications.
How could a ship made out of wood hold together in those mountainous waves?
What do you think will be the result of this storm?
The Turkish navy will be broken up.
The wind’s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky.
I’ve never seen the waters so disturbed.
If the Turkish fleet isn’t protected in some harbor, their men must all be drowned.
No ship could survive this storm.
I’ve got news, boys, the war’s over!
This terrible storm has smashed the Turks so badly that their plans are ruined.
One of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked.
What?
Is this true?
The ship’s sailing into harbor now; it’s from Verona.
Michael Cassio, lieutenant of the Moor Othello, has arrived on shore.
The Moor himself is still at sea.
He’s been commissioned to come here to Cyprus.
I’m happy about that.
He’ll be a good governor.
Cassio brings good news about the Turkish defeat, but he’s worried about the Othello’s safety.
The two of them were separated during the storm.
I hope to God Othello’s all right.
I served under him, and I know what an excellent commander he is.
Let’s go to the shore to get a look at the ship that came in, and to look out for Othello’s ship.
We’ll stare out at the sea until the sea and the sky blur together.
Let’s do that.
Every minute we expect more ships to arrive.
Thanks, you brave men who defend this island and respect Othello.
I hope heaven protects him from the weather, because I lost sight of him on the stormy sea.
Is his ship sturdy?
Yes, it’s well built, and the ship’s pilot is very expert and experienced.
For that reason I still have some hope for him, even though I don’t have my hopes up too high.
What’s all that shouting about?
Everybody in town is down at the shore shouting “A sail!” I hope it’s Othello.
They’ve fired a greeting shot, so at least it’s a friendly ship.
Please go find out for certain who has arrived.
I’ll do that.
Good lieutenant, is your general married?
Yes, and he’s very lucky to have married the woman he did.
His wife defies description.
She’s God’s masterpiece, and she’d exhaust whoever tried to do her justice while praising her.
Who’s arrived in the harbor?
A man named Iago, the general’s ensign.
He made good time.
You see how the storm, the jagged rocks, and the sand banks that trap ships all appreciate a beautiful woman.
They let the heavenly Desdemona arrive safe and sound.
Who’s that?
She’s the one I was talking about, the general’s wife.
The brave Iago was put in charge of bringing her here, and he’s arrived a week sooner than we expected.
Dear God, please protect Othello and help him arrive here safely, so he and Desdemona can be in each other’s arms, and Othello can cheer us up and bring comfort to Cyprus.
Look, the precious Desdemona has arrived on shore.
We should all kneel before her, men of Cyprus!
Greetings, my lady, and may God always be with you.
Thank you, brave Cassio.
Is there any news about my husband?
He hasn’t arrived yet.
As far as I know, he’s okay and will arrive here soon.
Oh, but I’m worried.
How did you two get separated?
The storm separated us.
Listen, they’ve spotted another ship!
They fired a greeting shot too, so this is also a friendly ship.
Go find out the news.
Ensign Iago, welcome.—And welcome to you, too, madam. 
you, as sure as your name’s Roderigo, if I were the Moor I wouldn’t want to be Iago.
I may seem to love and obey him, but in fact, I’m just serving him to get what I want.
If my outward appearance started reflecting what I really felt, soon enough I’d be wearing my heart on my sleeve for birds to peck at.
No, it’s better to hide it.
I’m not who I appear to be.
Let’s shout up to Desdemona’s father, wake him, pester him, spoil his happiness, spread rumors about him in the streets, enrage his relatives, and irritate him endlessly.
However real his happiness is, it will vanish in light of this.
Here’s her father’s house.
I’ll call out.
Do it, and shout like the city’s on fire.
Hey, Brabantio!
Signor Brabantio, hey!
Wake up, Brabantio!
Wake up!
Thieves!
Thieves!
Check on your daughter, your house, your money!
Thieves!
Thieves!
If she gave you as much lip as she gives me, you’d be sick of her by now.
On the contrary, she’s a soft-spoken woman.
No, she talks too much.
She’s always talking when I want to sleep.
I admit that in front of you, my lady, she keeps a bit quiet.
But she’s scolding me silently.
You have no reason to say that.
Come on, come on.
You women are all the same.
You’re as pretty as pictures when you’re out in public, but in your own houses you’re as noisy as jangling bells.
In your own kitchens you act like wildcats.
You make yourselves sound like saints when you’re complaining about something, but you act like devils when someone offends you.
You don’t take your jobs as housewives seriously, and you’re shameless hussies in bed.
Shame on you, you slanderer!
No, it’s true, or if it’s not, I’m a villain.
You wake up to have fun, and you start work when you go to bed.
You clearly have nothing good to say about me.
No, I don’t.
But if you had to say something nice about me, what would you say?
Don’t make me do it, my lady.
I’m critical by nature.
Come on, just try.—By the way, has someone gone down to the harbor?
Yes, madam.
I’m not as happy as I seem.
I’m just trying not to show how worried I am about Othello’s safety.
Come on, what would you say about me?
I’m trying to think of something, but I’m not good at inventing clever things.
It takes time.
Ah, I’ve got it.
If a woman is pretty and smart, she uses her good looks to get what she wants.
Very clever!
But what if the woman is smart but ugly?
Even if she’s ugly, she’ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her.
This is getting worse and worse!
What if she’s pretty but stupid?
No pretty woman is stupid, because her stupidity will make her more attractive to men.
These are stupid old jokes that men tell each other in bars.
What horrible thing do you have to say about a woman who’s both ugly and stupid?
No matter how ugly or stupid the woman is, she plays the same dirty tricks that the smart and pretty ones do.
You don’t know a thing!
You give your best praise to the worst women.
But how would you praise a truly good woman, someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her?
A woman who was beautiful but never proud, who could speak well but knew when to be quiet, who dressed well but was never overdressed, who had self-restraint even when she could get what she wanted, a woman who never took revenge, who overlooked it when people hurt her, who was too wise to do anything stupid, who could think without revealing her thoughts, and who could refrain from flirting with men in love with her, that kind of woman, if she ever existed, would— Would do what?
Would raise babies and clip coupons.
Oh, that’s pathetic!
Don’t listen to him, Emilia, even though he’s your husband.
What do you think about him, Cassio?
Isn’t he a horrible man?
He speaks bluntly, madam.
He’s more of a soldier than a wise man.  
If you lose your job because of little flirtations like this, you’ll wish you hadn’t been so courteous with her.
Oh, how nice, you’re  That’s the Moor!
I recognize his trumpet.
Yes, it is.
Let’s go greet him when he lands.
Look, here he comes.
My beautiful warrior!
My darling Othello!
I’m amazed you got here before me.
But I’m overjoyed!
My love, if the calm after the storm could always be this wonderful, I’d want the wind to blow until it waked the dead, and whipped up waves as tall as mountains!
If I died right now I’d be completely happy, since I’ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life.
God willing, our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older.
Amen to that!
I can’t talk about my happiness anymore.
It’s too much.
I hope these kisses I’m about to give you are the closest we ever come to fighting.
Let’s go up to the castle.
Good news, friends.
The war’s over and the Turks are drowned.
How are my old friends from this island doing?—Honey, they’ll love you here in Cyprus.
They’ve been very good to me here.
Oh, my dear, I’m blabbing on and on because I’m so happy.—Iago, would you be good enough to go get my trunks from the ships?
And bring the ship’s captain to the castle.
He’s a good man.—Let’s go, Desdemona.
I’ll say it again: I’m so happy to see you here in Cyprus!
Meet me down at the harbor.—Come here.
They say love makes cowards brave.
So if you’re brave, listen to me.
Lieutenant Cassio will be on guard duty tonight.
But first, I have to tell you that Desdemona’s completely in love with him.
With Cassio?
That’s impossible.
Be quiet and listen to me.
Remember how she fell madly in love with the Moor because he bragged and told her made-up stories?
Did you expect her to keep on loving him for his chattering?
You’re too smart to think that.
No, she needs someone nice-looking.
Othello’s ugly, what pleasure could she find in him?
Lovemaking gets boring after a while.
To keep things hot, she’ll need to see someone with a handsome face, someone close to her in age, someone who looks and acts like her.
Othello isn’t any of those things.
Since he doesn’t have these advantages to make him attractive to her, she’ll get sick of him until he makes her want to puke.
She’ll start looking around for a second choice.
Now, if that’s true—and it’s obviously true—who’s in a better position than Cassio?
He’s a smooth talker, and uses sophistication and fine manners to hide his lust.
Nobody’s as crafty as he is.
Besides, he’s young and handsome, and he’s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for.
He’s a bad boy, and Desdemona’s got her eye on him already.
I can’t believe that.
She’s not that kind of woman.
She’s very moral.
Like hell she is!
She’s made of the same flesh and blood as everyone else.
If she were so moral, she would never have fallen in love with the Moor in the first place.
Good lord!
Did you notice how she and Cassio were fondling each other’s hands?
Did you see that?
Yes, I did.
But that wasn’t romantic, it was just polite manners.
They were lusting after each other.
You could tell by how they were acting that they’re going to be lovers.
They were so close that their breath was mingling.
When two people get that intimate, sex will soon follow.
Disgusting!
But listen to me; let me guide you.
I brought you here from Venice.
Be on guard duty tonight.
I’ll put you in charge.
Cassio doesn’t know you.
I’ll be nearby.
Make Cassio angry somehow, either by speaking too loud, or insulting his military skills, or however else you want.
All right.
He’s hot-tempered, and he might try to hit you with his staff.
Try to get him to do that.
That’ll allow me to stir up public sentiment against him here in Cyprus.
I’ll get them so riled up that they’ll only calm down when Cassio’s fired.
To get what you want, you need to get Cassio out of the way.
If you don’t do that, things are hopeless for you.
I’ll do it, if you help me out.
I promise I will.
Meet me in a little while at the citadel.
I need to get Othello’s things from the ship.
Goodbye.
Goodbye.
I think Cassio really does love her, and it’s perfectly likely that she loves him too.
I can’t stand the Moor, but I have to admit that he’s a reliable, loving, and good-natured man.
He’d probably be a good husband to Desdemona.
I love her too, not simply out of lust, but also to feed my revenge.
I have a feeling the Moor slept with my wife.
That thought keeps gnawing at me, eating me up inside.
I won’t be satisfied until I get even with him, wife for wife.
If I can’t do that, I can at least make the Moor so jealous that he can’t think straight.
If that piece of Venetian trash Roderigo can do what I need to carry out my plan, I’ll have power over Cassio.
I’ll say bad things about him to the Moor.
I have a feeling Cassio seduced my wife as well.
I’ll make the Moor thank me, love me, and reward me, even though the joke will be on him the whole time.
I’ve got a good plan, though I haven’t worked out the details yet.
You can never see the end of an evil plan until the moment comes.
Our noble and courageous general Othello having been informed that the Turkish fleet has been completely destroyed, invites every man to celebrate our victory.
Some of you dance, some of you make bonfires, and every man celebrate in whatever way he likes to.
For besides the good news, we are also celebrating his marriage.
That’s the end of the announcement.
There will be a feast from five o'clock until eleven.
God bless the island of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!
Good Michael, keep a careful eye on the guards tonight.
Let’s exercise restraint and not let the party get too wild.
Iago has orders what to do.
But I’ll see to it personally anyway.
Iago’s a good man.
Goodnight, Michael.
Come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can.—Come with me, my dear love.
Now that the wedding’s over, we can have the pleasure of consummating our marriage.
Good night, everyone.
Hello, Iago.
It’s time for us to stand guard.
Not yet, lieutenant.
It’s not even ten o'clock.
The general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with Desdemona.—I can’t blame him.
He hasn’t spent the night with her yet, and she’s beautiful enough to be  She’s an exquisitely beautiful lady.
And I bet she’s good in bed too.
What’s the reason for this horrible shouting?
What’s the matter?
Sir, is everyone in your family at home?
Are your doors locked?
Why are you asking me that?
For God’s sake, sir, you’ve been robbed.
Get dressed.
Your heart’s going to break.
It’s like half your soul’s been ripped out.
At this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb.
Wake up, wake up, ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens.
If you wait too long you’ll have black grandchildren.
Get up, I tell you!
Are you crazy?
Do you recognize my voice, noble lord?
Not me.
Who are you?
My name’s Roderigo.
I told you not to hang around my house.
I’ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you.
Now you come here drunk to make trouble and startle me out of a sound sleep?
Sir, sir, sir—
Yes, she’s young and tender.
And such pretty eyes!
Like an invitation.
Yes, she’s pretty.
But she’s modest and ladylike too.
And when she speaks, doesn’t her voice stir up passion?
She’s a perfect woman, it’s true.
Well, good luck to them tonight in bed!
Come with us, lieutenant.
I’ve got a jug of wine, and these two Cyprus gentlemen want to drink a toast to the black Othello.
Not tonight, Iago.
I’m not much of a drinker.
I wish there was less social pressure to drink.
Oh, but these are our friends.
Just one glass.
I’ll do most of the drinking for you.
I’ve already had a glass of wine tonight, watered down, but look how drunk I am.
I’m not a heavy drinker.
I wouldn’t dare drink much more than that.
What are you talking about, man?
Tonight is for celebrating!
The gentlemen are waiting.
Where are they?
By the door.
Please invite them in.
I’ll do it, but I don’t like it.
If I can just get him to drink one more glass after what he’s drunk already, he’ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog.
That fool Roderigo, all twisted up inside with love, has been drinking toasts to Desdemona by the gallon, and he’s on guard duty.I’ve gotten the rest of the guards drunk, as well as several gentlemen from Cyprus who are quick to take offense.
Now I’ll get Cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island.
Here they come.
If the future turns out as I hope it will, I’m all set for success.
My God, they’ve given me a lot to drink.
No, it was a little one, not more than a pint.
Bring in more wine!              
My God, what a great song!
I learned it in England, where they have a talent for drinking.
The Danes, the Germans, and the Dutch—come on, drink, drink!—are nothing compared to the English.
Are Englishmen really such heavy drinkers?
They drink Danes under the table, and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink Germans.
And the Dutch are vomiting while the English are asking for refills.
Let’s drink to our general!
Hear, hear!
I’ll drink as much as you do!
Oh, sweet England!
God, that song’s even better than the other one.
Do you want to hear it again?
No, because we shouldn’t be doing that—stuff.
Oh well, God’s in charge, and some people have to go to heaven, while other people have to go to hell.
That’s true, lieutenant.
Speaking for myself—and no offense to the general or anyone else—I hope I’m going to heaven.
Me too, lieutenant.
Okay, but please not before me.
The lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign.
But let’s stop this drinking and get down to business.—God forgive our sins!—Gentlemen, let’s get down to business.
By the way, I don’t want anyone thinking I’m drunk.
This is my ensign.
This is my right hand, and this is my left hand.
I’m not drunk.
I can stand well enough, and I can speak just fine.
Yes, you’re speaking very well.
Yes, very well.
So don’t think that I’m drunk.
Let’s go to the platform where we’ll stand guard.
Come on.
You see that man who just left?
He’s a good soldier, good enough to be Caesar’s right-hand man.
But he has a serious weakness.
It’s too bad.
I’m worried that Othello trusts him too much, and it’ll be bad for Cyprus eventually.
But is he often like this?
He drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep.
He’d stay up all night and all day if he didn’t drink himself to sleep.
The general should be informed about this.
Maybe he’s never noticed, or he only wants to see Cassio’s good side.
Don’t you think so?
And it’s too bad that the Moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command.
We should definitely say something to the Moor.
I wouldn’t say anything, not if you gave me the whole island for doing so.
I respect Cassio and I’d like to help cure his alcoholism— What’s that noise?
