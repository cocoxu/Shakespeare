Welcome, lady.
Welcome, dear madam.
Each heart in Rome does love and pity you.
Only th’ adulterous Antony, most large In his abominations, turns you off And gives his potent regiment to a trull That noises it against us.
Most certain.
Sister, welcome.
Pray you Be ever known to patience.
My dear’st sister!
