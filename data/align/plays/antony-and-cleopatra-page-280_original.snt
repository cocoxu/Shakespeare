Help me, my women!
Oh, he’s more mad Than Telamon for his shield.
The boar of Thessaly Was never so embossed.
To th’ monument!
There lock yourself and send him word you are dead.
The soul and body rive not more in parting Than greatness going off.
To th’ monument!— Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself.
Say that the last I spoke was “Antony,” And word it, prithee, piteously.
Hence, Mardian, And bring me how he takes my death.
