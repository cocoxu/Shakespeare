And will she yet abase her eyes on me, That cropped the golden prime of this sweet prince And made her widow to a woeful bed?
On me, whose all not equals Edward’s moiety?
On me, that halts and am misshapen thus?
My dukedom to a beggarly denier, I do mistake my person all this while!
Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot, Myself to be a marv'lous proper man.
I’ll be at charges for a looking glass And entertain a score or two of tailors To study fashions to adorn my body.
Since I am crept in favor with myself, I will maintain it with some little cost.
But first I’ll turn yon fellow in his grave And then return lamenting to my love.
Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass, That I may see my shadow as I pass.
