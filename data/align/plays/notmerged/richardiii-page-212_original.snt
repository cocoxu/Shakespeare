My lord, this argues conscience in your Grace, But the respects thereof are nice and trivial, All circumstances well considerèd.
You say that Edward is your brother’s son; So say we too, but not by Edward’s wife.
For first was he contract to Lady Lucy— Your mother lives a witness to that vow— And afterward by substitute betrothed To Bona, sister to the king of France.
These both put off, a poor petitioner, A care-crazed mother to a many sons, A beauty-waning and distressèd widow, Even in the afternoon of her best days, Made prize and purchase of his wanton eye, Seduced the pitch and height of his degree To base declension and loathed bigamy.
By her in his unlawful bed he got This Edward, whom our manners term “the Prince.” More bitterly could I expostulate, Save that, for reverence to some alive, I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
Then, good my lord, take to your royal self This proffered benefit of dignity, If not to bless us and the land withal, Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry From the corruption of abusing times Unto a lineal, true-derivèd course.
