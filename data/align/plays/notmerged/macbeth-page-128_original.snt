Sent he to Macduff?
He did, and with an absolute “Sir, not I,” The cloudy messenger turns me his back, And hums, as who should say “You’ll rue the time That clogs me with this answer.”      And that well might Advise him to a caution, t' hold what distance His wisdom can provide.
Some holy angel Fly to the court of England and unfold His message ere he come, that a swift blessing May soon return to this our suffering country Under a hand accursed!
I’ll send my prayers with him.
