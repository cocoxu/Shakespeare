Tis well th’art gone, If it be well to live, but better ’twere Thou fell’st into my fury, for one death Might have prevented many.—Eros, ho!— The shirt of Nessus is upon me.
Teach me, Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage.
Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o’ th’ moon, And with those hands that grasped the heaviest club Subdue my worthiest self.
The witch shall die.
To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall Under this plot.
She dies for ’t.—Eros, ho!
