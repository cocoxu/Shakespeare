But one fiend at a time, I’ll fight their legions o'er.
I’ll be thy second.
All three of them are desperate.
Their great guilt, Like poison given to work a great time after, Now 'gins to bite the spirits.
I do beseech you That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly And hinder them from what this ecstasy May now provoke them to.
Follow, I pray you.
