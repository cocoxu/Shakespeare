Gregory, on my word, we’ll not carry coals.
No, for then we should be colliers.
I mean, an we be in choler, we’ll draw.
Ay, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.
I strike quickly, being moved.
But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
To move is to stir, and to be valiant is to stand.
Therefore if thou art moved thou runn’st away.
A dog of that house shall move me to stand.
I will take the wall of any man or maid of Montague’s.
