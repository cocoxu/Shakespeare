Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck, Till thou applaud the deed.
Come, seeling night, Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day And with thy bloody and invisible hand Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond Which keeps me pale.
Light thickens, and the crow Makes wing to th' rooky wood.
Good things of day begin to droop and drowse; Whiles night’s black agents to their preys do rouse.
Thou marvel’st at my words: but hold thee still.
Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
So, prithee, go with me.
