When last the young Orlando parted from you, He left a promise to return again Within an hour, and pacing through the forest, Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy, Lo, what befell.
He threw his eye aside— And mark what object did present itself: Under an old oak, whose boughs were mossed with age And high top bald with dry antiquity, A wretched, ragged man, o'ergrown with hair, Lay sleeping on his back.
About his neck A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself, Who with her head, nimble in threats, approached The opening of his mouth.
But suddenly, Seeing Orlando, it unlinked itself And, with indented glides, did slip away Into a bush, under which bush’s shade A lioness, with udders all drawn dry, Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stir—for ’tis The royal disposition of that beast To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
This seen, Orlando did approach the man And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
Oh, I have heard him speak of that same brother, And he did render him the most unnatural That lived amongst men.
And well he might so do, For well I know he was unnatural.
But to Orlando: did he leave him there, Food to the sucked and hungry lioness?
