That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
She ate no meat today, nor none shall eat.
Last night she slept not, nor tonight she shall not.
As with the meat, some undeservèd fault I’ll find about the making of the bed, And here I’ll fling the pillow, there the bolster, This way the coverlet, another way the sheets.
Ay, and amid this hurly I intend That all is done in reverend care of her.
And, in conclusion, she shall watch all night, And if she chance to nod I’ll rail and brawl, And with the clamor keep her still awake.
This is a way to kill a wife with kindness, And thus I’ll curb her mad and headstrong humor.
He that knows better how to tame a shrew, Now let him speak; ’tis charity to show.
