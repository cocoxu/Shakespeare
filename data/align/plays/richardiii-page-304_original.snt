Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends, Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny, Have we marched on without impediment, Thus far into the bowels of the land And here receive we from our father Stanley Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar, That spoiled your summer fields and fruitful vines, Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough In your embowelled bosoms—this foul swine Is now even in the center of this isle, Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn.
From Tamworth thither is but one day’s march.
In God’s name, cheerly on, courageous friends, To reap the harvest of perpetual peace By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
Every man’s conscience is a thousand men, To fight against this guilty homicide.
I doubt not but his friends will turn to us.
He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
Which in his dearest need will fly from him.
All for our vantage.
Then, in God’s name, march.
True hope is swift, and flies with swallow’s wings.
Kings it makes gods, and meaner creatures kings.
