Wilt thou be gone?
It is not yet near day.
It was the nightingale, and not the lark, That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale.
Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.
Night’s candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
Yon light is not daylight, I know it, I.
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
Therefore stay yet.
Thou need’st not to be gone.
Let me be ta'en.
Let me be put to death.
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
I’ll say yon grey is not the morning’s eye.
Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia’s brow.
Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
I have more care to stay than will to go.
Come, death, and welcome!
Juliet wills it so.— How is ’t, my soul?
Let’s talk.
It is not day.
