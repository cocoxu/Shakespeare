O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me, Even daughter, welcome in no less degree.
I will not eat my word.
Now thou art mine, Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
Let me have audience for a word or two.
I am the second son of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day Men of great worth resorted to this forest, Addressed a mighty power, which were on foot In his own conduct, purposely to take His brother here and put him to the sword.
And to the skirts of this wild wood he came, Where, meeting with an old religious man, After some question with him, was converted Both from his enterprise and from the world, His crown bequeathing to his banished brother, And all their lands restored to them again That were with him exiled.
This to be true I do engage my life.
