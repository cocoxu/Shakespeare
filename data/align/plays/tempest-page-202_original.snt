Now my charms are all o'erthrown, And what strength I have’s mine own, Which is most faint.
Now, ’tis true, I must be here confined by you, Or sent to Naples.
Let me not, Since I have my dukedom got And pardoned the deceiver, dwell In this bare island by your spell, But release me from my bands With the help of your good hands.
Gentle breath of yours my sails Must fill, or else my project fails, Which was to please.
Now I want Spirits to enforce, art to enchant, And my ending is despair, Unless I be relieved by prayer, Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults.
As you from crimes would pardoned be, Let your indulgence set me free.
