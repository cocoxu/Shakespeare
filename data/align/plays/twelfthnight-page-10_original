There is a fair behavior in thee, captain, And though that nature with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee I will believe thou hast a mind that suits With this thy fair and outward character.
I prithee—and I’ll pay thee bounteously— Conceal me what I am, and be my aid For such disguise as haply shall become The form of my intent.
I’ll serve this duke.
Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him.
It may be worth thy pains, for I can sing And speak to him in many sorts of music That will allow me very worth his service.
What else may hap to time I will commit.
Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
Be you his eunuch, and your mute I’ll be.
When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
I thank thee.
Lead me on.
