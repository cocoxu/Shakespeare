No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot of thought, conceived of spleen, and born of madness, that blind rascally boy that abuses everyone’s eyes because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I am in love.
I’ll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando.
I’ll go find a shadow and sigh till he come.
And I’ll sleep.
