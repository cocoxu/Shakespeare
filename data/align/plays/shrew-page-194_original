Oh, no, good Kate.
Neither art thou the worse For this poor furniture and mean array.
If thou account’st it shame, lay it on me, And therefore frolic!
We will hence forthwith To feast and sport us at thy father’s house.
And bring our horses unto Long Lane end.
There will we mount, and thither walk on foot.
Let’s see, I think ’tis now some seven o'clock, And well we may come there by dinnertime.
I dare assure you, sir, ’tis almost two, And ’twill be supper time ere you come there.
It shall be seven ere I go to horse.
Look what I speak, or do, or think to do, You are still crossing it.
Sirs, let ’t alone.
I will not go today, and ere I do It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
