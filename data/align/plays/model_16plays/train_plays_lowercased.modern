i have half a mind to hit you before you speak again .
but if antony is alive , healthy , friendly with caesar , and not caesar ’ s prisoner , i ’ ll shower you with gold and pearls .
madam , he ’ s well .
that ’ s well spoken .
and he ’ s friendly with caesar .
you are an honest man .
caesar and he are better friends than ever .
i ’ m going to make you a rich man .
but yet , madam — i don ’ t like the sound of “ but yet . ” it reverses all the good that came before it .
damn those words , “ but yet ! ” “ but yet ” is like a jailer about to bring out some horrible criminal .
please , my friend , give me all the news , both good and bad , at the same time .
you say he ’ s friendly with caesar , healthy , and free .
i didn ’ t say free , madam .
no , i didn ’ t say that .
he ’ s bound to octavia .
for what favor ?
for the favor of sleeping in her bed .
i ’ m sick , charmian .
he ’ s married to octavia , madam .
may you die of the worst disease !
good madam , be patient .
what did you say to me ?
get out , you horrible bastard , or i ’ ll gouge out your eyes .
i ’ ll scalp you .
i ’ ll have you whipped with wire and soaked in brine like a pickle , making your pain linger .
if you say it isn ’ t true , i ’ ll give you a province and make you rich .
the blows i gave you already will make up for your upsetting me .
he ’ s married , madam .
rogue , you ’ ve lived too long !
no way , then , i ’ ll run .
what ’ s the matter with you , madam ?
i haven ’ t done anything to you .
good madam , restrain yourself .
the man hasn ’ t done anything wrong .
even innocents cannot always escape disaster .
may egypt drown in the nile and all good creatures turn into poisonous snakes .
call that servant back .
even though i ’ m mad , i won ’ t bite him .
call him !
he ’ s afraid to come in .
i won ’ t hurt him .
my hands are tainted if they hit an inferior , especially since i myself am the cause of my own distress .
come here , sir .
it may be honest , but it ’ s never wise to bring bad news .
you can give good news in many ways , but let bad news interpret itself as you tell it .
i ’ ve only done my duty .
is he married ?
may the gods destroy you !
do you maintain the same story ?
do you want me to lie , madam ?
go , get out !
even if you were as handsome as i beg your highness ’ pardon .
is he really married ?
please don ’ t be offended that i don ’ t want to offend you any more .
it ’ s not fair to punish me for something you make me do .
he ’ s married to octavia .
it ’ s too bad that antony ’ s fault should make you look like a jerk .
go away .
the merchandise you bring from rome is too expensive for me .
let it stay in your inventory until it bankrupts you .
be patient , your highness .
when i have praised antony , i ’ ve disparaged caesar .
many times , madam .
i ’ m being repaid for that now .
help me out of here .
oh , iras , charmian !
it doesn ’ t matter .
how old is she ?
don ’ t let him leave out the color of her hair .
bring me his answers quickly .
even though half of him is like a
lord alexas , sweet alexas , most anything alexas , almost the most consummate alexas , where ’ s the fortuneteller you recommended so highly to the queen ?
oh , i only wish i knew the name of that husband you said he predicted will have a cheating wife !
i don ’ t make fortunes ; i only see them .
then see a good one for me .
no , he means you ’ ll use makeup when you ’ re old .
may my wrinkles forbid that !
don ’ t joke about his predictions .
pay attention .
quiet !
you will love more than you are loved .
why did cassius conspire against caesar ?
take your time .
pompey , you cannot frighten us with your navy .
we ’ ll meet you at sea .
yes , on land you do outnumber me .
even more since you annexed my father ’ s house and lands .
but since , to get back to the matter at hand , what do you think of our proposal ?
that ’ s the point .
don ’ t let us talk you into anything , but consider carefully the value of our offers .
you have offered me the lands of sicily and sardinia .
in return , i must clear the sea of pirates and send tributes of wheat to rome .
if i agree to this , we may leave unharmed , with our shields undented .
that ’ s our offer .
you should know that when i came here i was prepared to accept your offer .
let me shake your hand .
i didn ’ t think i would see you here .
the east is very seductive .
well , i cannot tell how my difficult life has weathered my face , but i will never let those difficulties subdue my courage .
it ’ s good we had this meeting .
i hope it works out for the best , lepidus .
so we are in agreement .
that ’ s the next thing on the agenda .
we ’ ll have celebration feasts for each other before we go our separate ways .
i ’ ll give the first one , pompey .
no , antony .
whether your banquet is first or last , your egyptian cooking will make it the best .
i heard that julius caesar got fat from all the feasting there .
you ’ ve heard a lot .
i mean well , sir .
i ’ m sure you do .
i ’ ve heard a lot more .
i heard that apollodorus carried — what did he carry , please ?
how are you , soldier ?
i ’ m well , and probably will be for a while , as i hear that four feasts are being prepared .
let me shake your hand .
i ’ ve never been your enemy .
i ’ ve seen you fight and envied your skill .
sir , i wouldn ’ t say i was your friend , but i ’ ve praised you when you deserved ten times more praise than i gave .
enjoy your frankness ; it suits you .
i invite you all aboard my ship .
after you , my lords ?
show us the way , sir .
come with me .
i think it was at sea .
that it was , sir .
you ’ ve done well at sea .
and you ’ ve done well on land .
i ’ ll flatter anyone who flatters me — though what i ’ ve accomplished on land cannot be denied .
neither can my accomplishments at sea .
yes , for your own safety , you should deny one thing : you have been a great thief at sea .
as you were on land .
that ’ s the one part of my service on land i do deny .
but let ’ s shake hands , menas .
if our eyes were policemen , they might capture two thieves at once while we ’ re embracing .
men ’ s faces are truthful , whatever their hands do .
but no beautiful woman has an honest face .
that ’ s no lie .
they steal hearts .
we came here to fight against you .
for my part , i ’ m sorry this battle turned into a drinking match .
today pompey laughs away his fortune .
if that ’ s true , he won ’ t get it back by crying .
that ’ s the truth , sir .
we didn ’ t expect mark antony to be here .
is he married to cleopatra ?
caesar ’ s sister is named octavia .
that ’ s true , sir .
she was previously caius marcellus ’ wife .
but she is now mark antony ’ s wife .
excuse me , sir ?
it ’ s true .
then caesar and he will always be united .
if i were to make a prediction regarding this union , i wouldn ’ t say that .
i think the marriage was made more for political reasons than for love .
i think so too .
but you ’ ll see that the very thing that joins them will be the thing that separates them .
octavia has a pious , chaste , meek disposition .
doesn ’ t everyone want a wife like that ?
not someone who doesn ’ t share that disposition , meaning mark antony .
he ’ ll go back to his egyptian dish .
then octavia ’ s complaints will rouse caesar , and as i said before , the thing that brought them together will part them .
antony will go where his passion is .
he only married out of political necessity .
then that ’ s the way it may turn out .
come on , sir , will you come aboard ?
i want to drink your health .
i ’ ll join you , sir .
we did a lot of drinking in egypt .
let ’ s go .
here ’ s where they ’ ll end up , on the floor .
some of them are leaning already .
lepidus is red in the face .
they made him drink the leftover wine usually given to the poor .
i ’ d rather carry a reed that obviously can ’ t protect me than a sword i cannot lift .
this is how they do it , sir : they measure the depth of the nile , according to certain marks made on the walls of the pyramid .
they know by those measurements if there will be famine or plenty .
the higher the nile flows , the better the harvest .
the harvest comes shortly after that .
do you have unusual snakes there ?
yes , lepidus .
the egyptian snake is born when the sun shines on the nile mud , just like the crocodile .
i don ’ t feel so well , but i won ’ t stop .
not until you pass out .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ll keep going until then .
i ’ ve heard that the pyramids build by the ptolemies are splendid .
without doubt i ’ ve heard that .
what does a crocodile look like ?
sir , it ’ s shaped like itself and is as wide as it has width .
it is only as high as it is and moves with its own legs .
its own color .
it ’ s a strange snake .
it is that .
and its tears are wet .
what is it ?
i ’ ve always had great respect for your destiny .
you ’ ve served me faithfully .
what else can i say ?
what are you saying ?
would you like to be king of the entire world ?
now i ’ ve said it twice .
how could that happen ?
just listen to him .
be kind now and tell me some excellent fortune .
tell me that i ’ ll marry three kings before noon and be widowed by all of them .
oh , excellent !
then my children will probably be illegitimate .
tell me , please : how many boys and girls will i have ?
if every time you wished for a child you could have had one , you would have a million children .
you seem to think no one outside of your bedroom knows what you wish .
we ’ ll all want our fortune told .
my fortune — like that of many of us tonight — is to go drunk to bed .
are you drunk ?
no , pompey , i haven ’ t had anything to drink .
tell me how .
the three who share the known world are aboard your boat .
everything that belongs to them is yours .
oh , you should have done it without telling me !
for you to do it would be good service .
you should know that to me , profit isn ’ t more important than honor , but the other way around .
regret that your mouth betrayed your actions .
but now i must condemn it .
give it up and go drink .
this toast is for lepidus !
here ’ s to you , menas .
i accept with thanks , enobarbus .
there goes a strong fellow , menas .
why do you say that ?
he carries a third of the world .
can ’ t you see that ?
then a third of the world is drunk .
drink up .
all right , then .
this hasn ’ t reached the level of an egyptian feast yet .
it ’ s getting there .
clink your cups together in a toast !
here ’ s to caesar .
i could do without another toast .
live in the moment .
but i would rather abstain from everything for four days than drink so much in one .
let ’ s have one , good soldier .
come , let ’ s join our hands until the overpowering wine makes us soft and forgetful .
everyone join hands .
how can you top that ?
good night , pompey .
yes , we will .
let ’ s shake on it .
we ’ re friends !
come , this way to the rowboat .
be careful not to fall in .
menas , i ’ m not going back on shore .
no , come to my cabin .
what do you say ?
there ’ s my hat !
hooray !
come on , noble captain .
now i ’ ve paid you back , parthia , and gotten revenge for marcus crassus ’ death .
you must understand , silius , that it ’ s better to leave something undone than achieve too much fame in your superior ’ s absence .
caesar and antony have always achieved more by delegating authority to their officers than by leading their troops in person .
a man who achieves more in war than his captain does becomes his captain ’ s rival .
i could do more to help antony , but to do so would insult him .
a soldier is just a tool , like his sword , unless he has your qualities , ventidius .
are you going to write antony about this ?
i ’ ll write how , under his flag and with his well-paid troops , we have beaten the formerly unvanquished parthia .
where ’ s antony now ?
did the brothers-in-law leave ?
they finished their business with pompey , and pompey has left .
octavia weeps at the thought of leaving rome .
caesar is in a sober mood .
he ’ s a stylish man .
and how he loves caesar !
yes , but how he adores mark antony !
caesar ?
then what ’ s antony ?
a god of a god ?
are you talking about caesar ?
he ’ s without equal !
oh , antony !
oh , you if you want to praise caesar , just say his name — that ’ s all the praise that ’ s necessary .
he certainly flattered them both with extravagant compliments .
he loves caesar best , but he also loves antony .
oh !
hearts cannot think it , tongues cannot speak it , meas-urements cannot calculate it , scribes cannot write it , bards cannot sing it , and poets cannot make verses about it .
he loves them both .
they are his dung , and he their beetle .
so , there ’ s the signal to ride .
good-bye , noble agrippa .
good luck , worthy soldier , and good-bye .
you can ’ t go any further with us , sir .
if you and i don ’ t value her equally , it would be better for us to work out our differences without her .
don ’ t insult me with your distrust .
i mean what i say .
you won ’ t find any cause for anxiety , even if you look for one .
so , may the gods protect you and change the hearts of the romans so that they turn and give you their support .
we ’ ll leave you here .
good-bye , my dearest sister , good-bye .
i hope you have good weather to set your mind at ease .
farewell .
my noble brother !
her eyes are like april : full of showers .
what is it , octavia ?
i ’ ll tell you privately .
see , now i have you .
and thus i let you go and give you to the gods .
good-bye .
be happy .
farewell , farewell .
farewell .
like the oh stop it , you lusty bed-hopper .
you can ’ t see the future .
well , if a moist palm isn ’ t a clear sign of promiscuity , then i can ’ t scratch my own ear .
your fortunes are the same .
but how ?
give me details .
i ’ ve said what i have to say .
isn ’ t my fortune just a little better than hers ?
well , if you could have just an inch of better fortune than me , where would you like the improvement ?
not in my husband ’ s nose .
may heaven save us from indecent thoughts !
alexas !
if it ’ s sad to see a handsome man with a cheating wife , it ’ s a tragedy to see an ugly thug with a wife who ’ s faithful .
therefore , dear isis , do the right thing and give him the fortune he deserves .
where is that messenger ?
he ’ s afraid to come in .
oh , come on . — come here , sir .
gracious queen , even herod of judea wouldn ’ t dare look at you unless you were in a good mood .
i ’ ll have herod ’ s head chopped off !
most formidable queen !
did you see octavia ?
yes , revered queen .
where ?
in rome , madam .
i saw her face as she walked with her brother and mark antony .
is she as tall as i am ?
she is not , madam .
did you hear her speak ?
is her voice pitched high or low ?
madam , i heard her speak .
she has a low-pitched voice .
that ’ s not in her favor .
he can ’ t like her very long .
like her ?
oh , isis , that ’ s impossible .
you ’ re right , charmian .
she creeps along .
she has a body , not a life .
is this true ?
if not , then i have no powers of observation .
there aren ’ t three people in all of egypt who could do better .
she doesn ’ t have anything going for her so far .
this messenger is wise .
very wise .
do you hear that , charmian ?
and i think she ’ s at least thirty .
do you remember her face ?
was it long or round ?
round enough to be unattractive .
usually that means a person is foolish .
what color is her hair ?
brown , madam , and she wouldn ’ t want her forehead to be any lower .
you mustn ’ t hold my earlier outburst against me .
i ’ ll hire you again to go back to rome .
my letters are ready to go .
he ’ s an admirable man .
he certainly is .
i ’ m very sorry i was so hard on him .
not a bit , madam .
everything may still be all right .
i assure you it is , madam .
oh , dear husband , don ’ t believe everything you hear — or if you must believe it , don ’ t let it all make you angry .
no lady could be more miserable than i if you two disagree .
gentle octavia , support the one that supports you .
in the meantime , i ’ ll raise an army that will surpass his .
may the god of power make me , the weakest of the weak , your mediator .
when you find out who started this disagreement , turn your anger upon them .
order supplies for your trip and choose your traveling companions .
how goes it , friend eros ?
some startling news has just arrived , sir .
what news , man ?
caesar and lepidus declared war against pompey .
that ’ s old news .
who ’ s winning ?
so the weak third of the triumvirate is imprisoned until death frees him .
and even if you throw everything you possess to the two of them , they ’ ll battle each other to the death to have it all .
where ’ s antony ?
another thing , domitius : antony wants to see you now .
i should have waited to tell you my news .
but never mind .
take me to antony .
come with me , sir .
in alexandria he condemned rome , and that ’ s not all .
this is what happened : he and cleopatra sat on chairs of gold on a silver-covered stage in the marketplace .
he did this in public ?
he gave syria , cilicia , and phoenicia to ptolemy .
let ’ s send this news to rome .
the roman people are fed up with his arrogance already .
the people have heard it already , and they ’ ve been told of his accusations .
who does he accuse ?
he accuses me of withholding his share of sextus pompeius ’ possessions , which we seized in sicily .
then he says i didn ’ t return some ships he loaned me .
sir , these accusations should be answered .
it has been done already , and the messenger is on his way .
i answered that lepidus had become too brutal and abused his position .
he ’ ll never agree to that .
then we won ’ t agree to his demands .
greetings , caesar , my lord !
greetings , dearest caesar !
oh , to think you ’ ve been rejected !
you ’ ve never thought of me like that , and you have no reason to .
then why did you travel so quietly ?
you didn ’ t arrive like caesar ’ s sister .
antony ’ s wife should have an army to escort her , with neighing horses to announce her arrival long before she appears .
the dust from your attending troops should have risen to heaven .
i would have met you by sea and again by land .
mark antony heard that you were preparing to wage war on him .
which he quickly allowed , given that you ’ re an obstacle to his lust .
amen .
quiet !
here comes antony .
have you seen my lord ?
no , lady .
wasn ’ t he here ?
no , madam .
he was in a good mood , and then suddenly he started thinking of rome .
madam ?
here , at your service .
here comes my lord .
your wife , fulvia , mustered her army first .
against my brother lucius ?
yes .
don ’ t say that , my lord .
where do you think he is now ?
he ’ s in athens , my lord .
no , he ’ s not .
cleopatra summoned him .
he ’ s given his empire to a whore , and now they ’ re gathering kings to wage a war .
i ’ m divided between two friends who are determined to kill each other .
you ’ re welcome here .
i didn ’ t write about breaking the alliance with antony until i saw you were being misled and realized how dangerous it would be to keep postponing preparations .
cheer yourself .
you will always be welcome to me .
welcome , lady .
welcome , dear madam .
every heart in rome loves and pities you .
only the adulterous and abominable antony abandons you , giving his power to a whore who turns that power against us .
it ’ s undeniable .
you are welcome here , sister .
i beg you to continue to be patient .
my dearest sister !
but why , why , why ?
you opposed my taking part in the war .
isn ’ t this war against me ?
why shouldn ’ t i be there in person ?
what do you mean ?
let rome fall !
may the tongues of our critics rot !
i have responsibilities in this war , and as the absolute ruler of my kingdom i will carry out my duties as if i were a man .
don ’ t argue against it .
i won ’ t stay behind .
no , i ’ ve had my say .
here comes the emperor .
isn ’ t it strange , canidius , that he could cross the ionian sea so quickly from tarentum and brundusium and take toryne ? — have you heard about this , sweet ?
no one admires speed more than the lazy .
what else ?
why do you want to do that , my lord ?
because he ’ s daring us to do it .
so you ’ ve dared him to single combat .
yes , and you dared caesar to fight the battle at pharsalia , where he fought against pompey .
but caesar ignores offers that don ’ t give him an advantage , and so should you .
his ships are maneuverable .
yours are slow and awkward .
refusing to fight him at sea won ’ t disgrace you .
i ’ ll fight at sea .
even if we fail at that , we can still fight him on land .
what ’ s your business ?
the news is true , my lord .
he has captured toryne .
canidius , take our nineteen
what ’ s the news , brave soldier ?
oh , don ’ t fight by sea , noble emperor !
don ’ t trust rotten planks .
don ’ t you trust my sword and these wounds ?
let the egyptians and phoenicians go swimming .
we are used to winning by standing on the earth and fighting toe to toe .
well , well , let ’ s go .
by hercules , i think i ’ m right .
soldier , you are .
our leader is being led .
on land you keep the legions and cavalry together , don ’ t you ?
marcus octavius , marcus justeius , publicola , and caelius will go by sea , but we ’ ll keep the bulk on land .
caesar ’ s speed defies belief .
while he was still in rome , he deployed his forces in so many different disguises that all our spies were fooled .
who ’ s his lieutenant , do you know ?
a man named taurus , they say .
i know the man well .
the emperor is calling for canidius .
the present time is like a woman in labor , each minute giving birth to some piece of news .
taurus !
my lord ?
don ’ t attack by land .
don ’ t provoke them to battle until we have finished at sea .
our fate depends on this chance .
assemble our squadrons on the other side of the hill , in sight of caesar ’ s navy .
i can ’ t watch any more .
the egyptian flagship , the gods and goddesses — the whole congregation of them !
what ’ s wrong with you ?
we have lost a major portion of the world through utter foolishness .
we have kissed away entire kingdoms and provinces .
how goes the battle ?
i saw that .
the sight made me so sick i couldn ’ t watch any more .
well , give me the worst news .
the bearer of bad news is often blamed for it .
only if the hearer is a fool or a coward .
go on .
as far as i ’ m concerned , what ’ s past is done .
it ’ s like this : as long as a person tells me the truth , even though it means my death , i will listen as though he praised me .
oh , my lord !
speak plainly .
call cleopatra what the romans call her .
it ’ s easy to err when left to our own devices , but criticism helps us to see our faults and correct them .
good-bye for a while .
i never saw such a shameful act .
terrible .
terrible .
the battle on the sea is almost lost .
if our general had been his old self , we would have won .
oh , with his sordid desertion , he sets the example for our own .
are you considering desertion , as well ?
then everything must really be finished .
they fled toward peloponnesus .
i ’ ll yield my legions and cavalry to caesar .
listen .
friends , come here .
i ’ m completely lost .
i have a ship full of treasure .
escape and make peace with caesar .
flee ?
not us .
i ’ ve told cowards to turn their backs on me and run .
friends , go .
i ’ ve decided on a plan that doesn ’ t require your assistance .
leave .
oh , i followed something i ’ m ashamed to look at now !
even my hair revolts .
friends , go .
i ’ ll give you letters of introduction to some friends of mine who will help you .
please , don ’ t be sad , and don ’ t tell me how reluctant you are .
take your cues from my own despair .
abandon the person that has abandoned himself .
go to the harbor immediately !
i ’ ll give you the title to that ship and its treasure .
just give me a moment , please — only a moment .
i ’ ve relinquished my authority , so please — i ’ ll see you all before long .
what else ?
let me sit down .
oh , damn , damn , damn !
madam !
madam , oh , good empress !
the queen is here , my lord .
go to him , madam , speak to him .
he ’ s not himself because he feels so ashamed .
well , then , help me .
most noble sir , stand up .
the queen is coming .
she ’ s weak and will die unless you comfort her .
i ’ ve destroyed my reputation , a most shameful error .
sir , here ’ s the queen .
oh , where have you led me , egypt ?
oh , my lord , my lord , forgive my panic !
i didn ’ t think you would follow me .
queen , you knew very well that my heart was tied to your ship and that you would pull me along with you .
you knew that my spirit was completely under your control and that i would ignore the gods ’ orders in favor of yours .
oh , forgive me !
now i will have to send my humble proposal of peace to that young man .
you knew that my sword , weakened by my love for you , would obey that love no matter what .
don ’ t shed even one tear .
one of your tears is worth everything that was won and lost .
give me a kiss .
this repays me .
let the envoy from antony come in .
do you know him ?
come forward and speak .
humble as i am , i represent antony .
until recently , i was as unimportant to his affairs as the morning dew is to the wide ocean .
so be it .
say what you ’ re here for .
if that is not granted , he reduces his requests and asks only that he be allowed to live as a private man in athens .
that ’ s all he asks for himself .
cleopatra recognizes your greatness and accepts your authority .
as for antony , i ’ m not interested in his requests .
i ’ ll give the queen a hearing and grant her requests if she either throws her dishonored friend out of egypt or kills him .
then i ’ ll listen to her .
give my answer to them both .
may good luck follow you !
take him safely through the lines .
i go , caesar .
observe how antony takes his defeat and how his attitude influences his actions .
i will , caesar .
what are we going to do , enobarbus ?
think about our situation , then die .
who is to blame for this : antony or i ?
only antony was at fault .
why should he have followed you ?
with half the world opposing the other half , it wasn ’ t the time for antony , the pivotal player , to let love distract him .
to race after your departing ships , leaving his navy to watch , was a shame as great as the resulting loss .
please , let ’ s not talk about it .
is that his answer ?
yes , my lord .
the queen will be treated fairly if she gives me up ?
that ’ s what he says .
tell her .
your head , my lord ?
a messenger has arrived from caesar .
with no more ceremony than that ?
see , ladies , how they scorn me now .
i ’ ll be at your service .
he ’ s waiting outside .
what ’ s your message ?
your wife , fulvia , is dead .
where did she die ?
in sicyon .
in this letter you ’ ll find details of her illness and other , more serious matters that concern you .
leave me .
what does caesar want ?
it is for your ears only .
there are only friends here .
speak confidently .
so they are possibly antony ’ s friends .
sir , he should have as many as caesar has .
if caesar chose , antony would jump at the chance to be his friend .
as for us , you know we are antony ’ s , and he is caesar ’ s .
just remember that he is caesar .
he knows that you didn ’ t embrace antony because you loved him , but because you feared him .
oh !
he is like a god and knows the truth .
my honor wasn ’ t given ; it was only dominated .
shall i tell caesar what you request from him ?
he almost begs for the opportunity to help you .
it would please him very much if you would rely on his wealth and success to support you .
but he would feel even better if i could tell him that you had left antony and put yourself under his protection .
what ’ s your name ?
my name is thidias .
most kind messenger , tell great caesar that through his deputy i kiss his conquering hand .
tell him i am ready to lay my crown at his feet and kneel before him .
promising favors ?
by jove that thunders !
who are you , slave ?
you will be whipped .
take away this lout and whip him .
by the moon and stars !
whip him !
if i saw twenty of the greatest powers that pay tribute to caesar taking such liberties with her hand — what ’ s her name now ?
whip him , fellows , until he screws up his face like a baby and cries aloud for mercy !
take him away .
caesar ’ s knave will bring him a message for us .
my good lord — you ’ ve always been a liar .
but when our vices become habits — oh , the sadness of it ! — the wise gods blind us , shade our better judgment , make us love our mistakes , and laugh as we strut to our ruin .
oh , has it come to this ?
you were a cold crumb on dead julius caesar ’ s plate when i met you .
no , you were one of gneius pompey ’ s leftovers — not to mention your other , more depraved affairs , which have somehow managed to avoid becoming the subject of vulgar gossip .
for i ’ m sure that although you may know what temperance is , you ’ ve never experienced it firsthand .
why are you doing this ?
soundly , my lord .
did he cry ?
did he beg my pardon ?
he did ask for mercy .
are you done yet ?
you , my earthly moon , are now eclipsed , and that alone foretells my ruin .
in order to flatter caesar , would you flirt with the servant who laces up his pants ?
don ’ t you know me still ?
has your heart cooled toward me ?
ah , dear , if that is true , let heaven make poisonous hail grow from my heart , and let the first hailstone drop down my throat .
as it dissolves , so shall my life .
the next hailstone should hit caesarion , until one by one all my children , and every one of my brave egyptians , are killed by the dissolving of this pellet storm and lie unburied , covered by gnats and flies .
i am satisfied .
i will fight him there .
our land forces have bravely stood firm .
our tattered navy has reassembled and set sail , as formidable as the sea itself .
where have you been , my bravery ?
do you hear what i say , lady ?
if i come back from the battlefield again to kiss those lips , i ’ ll be covered in blood .
my sword and i will earn our place in history .
we still have hope .
that ’ s my brave lord !
i ’ ll fight brutally .
but now i ’ ll grit my teeth and kill anyone who tries to stop me .
come , let ’ s have one more extravagant night .
invite all my sad captains .
let ’ s drink through midnight .
it ’ s my birthday .
i had planned to celebrate it quietly , but since my lord is once more himself , i will be cleopatra again .
we ’ ll win yet .
do so .
i ’ ll speak to them , and then tonight i ’ ll get them all so drunk that the wine seeps out of their old war wounds .
now he ’ ll work himself up to a fury .
when courage consumes reason , it destroys its only weapon .
i ’ ll look for some way to leave his service .
he calls me “ boy ” and scolds me as if he had the power to whip me out of egypt .
let the old ruffian discover that i have many other ways to die , and in the meantime , we ’ ll laugh at his challenge .
don ’ t give him time to catch his breath .
anger does not protect the angry well .
tell our top commanders that i want tomorrow ’ s battle to be the last we fight .
our army has recently acquired many of mark antony ’ s former soldiers — enough to capture him .
see that it is done , and prepare a feast for the soldiers .
we have enough supplies for it , and they ’ ve earned it .
poor antony !
what would you like , sir ?
i have to leave right away .
that will kill our lovers .
we know how much they suffer if we are unkind to them .
if we leave , it will feel like nothing less than death to them .
i must be gone .
if it ’ s that important , then let the women die .
it would be a pity to throw them away for nothing , but if it ’ s a matter of choosing between them and a great cause , then they ’ re worthless .
if cleopatra hears even a breath of this , she ’ ll die immediately .
i ’ ve seen her claim to be dying twenty times before , and for far less reason .
i think there must be something invigorating about death , since she dies with such enthusiasm .
she ’ s more cunning than anyone can imagine .
her sighs and tears are like great winds and floods .
he won ’ t fight with me , domitius ?
no .
why won ’ t he ?
he thinks that since his fortune is twenty times better than yours , it would be like pitting twenty men against one .
tomorrow , soldier , i ’ ll fight by sea and land .
by the end i will either live , or else i ’ ll restore my honor by shedding my blood .
will you fight well ?
when i strike , i ’ ll cry , “ all or nothing ! ” well put .
come on .
call out my household servants .
tonight let ’ s have plenty to eat .
you have all served me well , and kings are your peers .
the gods forbid !
well , my good fellows , wait on me tonight .
keep my cups full and treat me as you did when my empire was one of your fellow servants , obeying my commands .
look — they ’ re crying .
ha , ha , ha !
may the evil one take me if i meant it like that !
those tears will bring blessings to you .
you interpret my words in a melancholy sense , my hearty friends .
you should know , my friends , that i have good hopes for tomorrow , and that i will lead you as if i expect victory rather than an honorable death .
good night , brother .
tomorrow is the day .
have you heard about anything unusual happening in the city ?
no .
what was it ?
it was probably just a rumor .
good night .
well sir , good night .
soldiers , watch carefully .
you too .
this is our station .
and if our navy wins tomorrow , no doubt our army will do their part .
it ’ s an outstanding army and highly motivated .
quiet !
what ’ s that sound ?
listen !
there ’ s music coming out of thin air .
from under the earth .
it ’ s a lucky sign , isn ’ t it ?
no .
quiet , i say .
what does this mean ?
hello there , good sirs .
yes .
isn ’ t it strange ?
do you hear that , men ?
do you ?
let ’ s follow the music as far as we can without leaving our station and see if it stops .
good idea .
it ’ s very strange .
get a little sleep .
come on , good fellow , help me into that armor you ’ re carrying .
if luck deserts us today , it ’ s because we defy it .
come on .
no , i ’ ll help too .
what ’ s this part for ?
ah , leave it alone .
you armor my heart .
no !
no !
really , i ’ ll help .
it must go like this .
we ’ ve got it now . — do you see this , my good fellow ?
go and put on your own armor .
in a minute , sir .
didn ’ t i buckle this well ?
excellently , excellently .
hurry . — oh , love , if you could only watch the battle today and see how expert i am at my craft .
good morning to you .
welcome .
you look like a person who knows the business of war .
when we love our job we get up early and go to it joyfully .
even though it ’ s early , there are already a thousand armored soldiers waiting for you at the harbor .
the weather is fair .
good morning , general .
good morning , general .
that was a fine fanfare , boys .
like a young man who wants to amount to something , this morning begins early .
farewell , lady .
whatever happens to me , this is a soldier ’ s kiss .
i ’ ll leave you without revealing any emotion , like a man of steel .
lead the way .
he goes forth to war bravely .
may the gods bless antony today !
i wish you and your scarred self had convinced me to wage our last battle on land .
if you had , the kings that have revolted and the soldier that deserted this morning would still be behind you .
who deserted this morning ?
you don ’ t know ?
someone who was always near you .
sir , he ’ s with caesar .
sir , he left his belongings and treasure .
he ’ s gone ?
it ’ s certain .
eros , send his treasure to him .
do it now .
don ’ t keep anything back , i insist .
write to him from me — i ’ ll sign it — sending greetings and gentle good-byes .
say that i hope he never has cause to look for a new master .
oh , my bad luck has forced honest men to become traitors .
hurry .
fulvia is dead .
pardon me ?
fulvia is dead .
fulvia ?
dead .
then you should offer the gods a sacrifice to show your thanks .
if fulvia were the last woman on earth , there would be a reason to grieve .
but in this way , grief and comfort appear together .
the only kind of tears you should shed in this case are the kind you might get from holding an onion to your nose .
i must go and continue the business fulvia started .
the business you began here needs you as well — especially the business with cleopatra , which only you can attend to .
enough of this frivolous talk .
give our officers notice of our intentions .
i ’ ll tell the queen the reason for our quick departure and get her permission to leave .
fulvia ’ s death and the pressing concerns related to it are not the only reasons i am eager to go ; friends in rome have also sent many letters advising my return .
the empire may be in danger if he ’ s not restrained before he reaches his full potential .
there are many troubles brewing now that have yet to become full-fledged threats .
agrippa , go start the battle .
we want antony taken alive .
make sure everyone knows that .
i will , caesar .
an era of universal peace is about to start .
that way antony will feel like he ’ s fighting his own men .
caesar hanged him for this service .
canidius and the others that left antony are given hospitality here but no positions of trust .
i ’ ve done a bad thing , for which i will blame myself so much that i ’ ll never be happy again .
enobarbus , antony has sent you all your treasure , with generous gifts besides .
the messenger arrived on my watch and is unloading his mules at your tent .
it ’ s yours .
don ’ t joke about this , enobarbus .
i ’ m telling you the truth .
you ’ d better bring the messenger safely through the lines so he can return .
i ’ d do it myself , but i can ’ t leave my post .
your emperor is still a king among gods .
i am the worst person alive , and i know it the best .
oh , antony , you extravagantly generous man , how would you have rewarded me for serving you faithfully when you reward my badness with all of this gold !
my heart feels like it ’ s about to explode .
if grief doesn ’ t kill me , i ’ ll find a quicker way to kill myself — even though i think grief will do the job just as well .
i , fight against you , antony ?
no , i ’ ll go find some ditch to die in .
the foulest fate would be most appropriate for me now in this latest phase of my life .
retreat !
we ’ ve advanced too far .
caesar himself is in trouble and there are more adversaries than we expected .
oh , my brave emperor , this is what i call a fight !
if we ’ d fought like this before , we ’ d have driven them home with bandaged heads .
you ’ re bleeding a lot .
i had a scar here that looked like a “ t ” ; now it ’ s an “ h. ” they ’ re retreating .
we ’ ll chase ’ em into their latrines .
i still have room for six more wounds .
they ’ re retreating , sir , and our superiority indicates a clear victory .
let ’ s slash their backs and grab ’ em like we do rabbits , from behind .
it ’ s fair game to mark a coward .
i ’ ll reward you once for your cheerfulness and ten times for your courage .
come on .
i ’ ll limp after you .
we ’ ve driven him all the way back to his camp .
one of you run to the queen with the news .
before sunrise tomorrow , we ’ ll kill anyone who escaped today .
you are all lord of lords !
have you returned smiling from the great battle for the world ?
my songbird , we have beaten them to their beds .
what do you think , girl !
look at this man .
today he fought as though he were a god who hated mankind .
he deserves it , even if it were covered with jewels like holy
if we aren ’ t relieved in an hour , we have to return to our barracks .
oh , listen to me , night — who is this ?
stay hidden and listen .
be my witness , oh you blessed moon .
that ’ s enobarbus ?
quiet !
keep listening .
my heart , which dried out with grief , will surely break apart into a powder , and that will be the end of my disgusting mind .
oh , antony !
let ’ s speak to him .
let ’ s listen to him .
good idea .
but he ’ s sleeping .
no one ever gave a prayer like that before going to sleep .
let ’ s go to him .
wake up , sir , wake up .
speak to us .
do you hear us , sir ?
the hand of death has taken him .
let ’ s carry him to the barracks .
he ’ s an important person .
our hour is up .
come on , then .
he may recover yet .
i will .
they ’ ve switched their operation to the sea today .
we didn ’ t please them on land .
we ’ re ready for both , my lord .
i wish they ’ d fight in fire or in the air .
but here ’ s the plan : our army will stay with us on the hills by the city .
let ’ s take up the best positions we can in the valleys .
they still haven ’ t joined the battle .
i ’ ll be able to see better from that pine tree over there .
i ’ ll let you know right away how it ’ s going .
swallows have built nests in cleopatra ’ s sails .
all is lost !
this treacherous egyptian has betrayed me .
three-time traitor and whore !
tell the army to flee .
order them to escape .
go !
oh , sun , i will never see another one of your sunrises .
luck and antony separate here and now .
here we ’ ll shake hands good-bye .
is it all come to this ?
i ’ ve been stripped of everything , betrayed .
oh , that devious egyptian spirit !
ah , you sorceress !
be gone !
why is my lord enraged against his love ?
get out of my sight , or i ’ ll give you what you deserve and spoil caesar ’ s victory .
let him hoist you up in front of the shouting crowds !
follow his chariot , like the greatest disgrace to your whole gender .
then let octavia dig up your face with her nails .
she ’ ll die for it . — eros , ho !
help me , ladies !
go to your tomb !
lock yourself in and send him word that you ’ re dead .
when a great person departs , it causes more pain than when the soul leaves the body .
say the last word i spoke was “ antony , ” and please word it pathetically .
go , mardian , and let me know how he reacts to my death .
eros , can you still see me ?
yes , noble lord .
you ’ ve seen these illusions .
yes , my lord .
what looks like a horse is quick as thought disfigured by the wind , made as difficult to distinguish as water poured into water .
that ’ s true , my lord .
eros , my young friend , your captain is now just like that cloud .
here and now i seem like antony , but i can ’ t keep myself in this form , my boy .
no , don ’ t cry , kind eros .
oh , your contemptible lady !
she has disarmed me .
get out , insolent eunuch !
silence !
she has betrayed me and shall die .
a person can only pay with their life once , and she has paid in full .
what you wanted is yours .
most noble antony ! ” then , as she was speaking your name , a strangled groan split her words .
antony ” was divided between her heart and lips .
she gave up her life with your name still within her .
is she dead , then ?
dead .
remove your armor , eros .
off !
take off my armor .
oh , chest , obey me !
heart , for once be stronger than all the rest of the body combined .
faster , eros , faster .
i won ’ t be a soldier anymore .
battered armor , be off .
you were worn with honor .
i will catch up with you , cleopatra , and weep for your forgiveness .
since the light of my life has gone out , i ’ ll stop here .
now any effort ruins what it attempts .
yes , even power gets in its own way .
end it , then , and everything is over . — eros ! — i ’ m coming , my queen ! — eros ! — wait for me .
in the place where souls recline on beds of flowers we ’ ll walk hand in hand and amaze the other ghosts with our spirited demeanor .
what can i do for my lord ?
since cleopatra died , i have lived in such dishonor that the gods despise my disgrace .
do it .
this is that time .
you won ’ t be striking me down , but defeating caesar .
call up your courage .
the gods forbid !
can i do what all the parthian arrows , though shot by enemies , could not ?
i would not .
draw your trustworthy sword , which you have used in such service to your country .
oh , sir , pardon me !
when i freed you from slavery , didn ’ t you swear to do this when i asked you ?
do it immediately , or all your previous services to me were accidental , without purpose .
take out your sword and come on .
then turn your noble face away from me , that face that the whole world adores .
look !
where is he ?
i haven ’ t seen him recently .
what should i do that i ’ m not doing ?
always give him his way .
never contradict him .
don ’ t push him too far .
i wish you ’ d be patient .
we come to hate that which controls us .
but here comes antony .
i am sick and sullen .
i ’ m sorry to have to say this — help me away from here , dear charmian !
i shall faint .
i have drawn my sword .
my dear master , my captain , my sovereign , let me say before i strike this fatal blow : farewell .
you ’ ve said it , friend , and farewell to you .
good-bye , great commander .
should i do it now ?
now , eros .
well , then , there !
with this i avoid the grief of antony ’ s death .
my queen and eros have by their brave examples beaten me to the history books .
i learned to do this from you .
what !
i ’ m not dead ?
oh , kill me !
what ’ s the trouble ?
i ’ ve botched the job , friends .
oh , finish what i ’ ve begun .
our guiding light is out .
and time itself is ended .
sadness and despair !
whoever ’ s a real friend should strike me dead .
not me .
me neither .
none of us .
your death and destiny advise your followers to escape .
i only need to show your sword to caesar and tell him about your death to get into his good favor .
where ’ s antony ?
there , diomedes , there .
is he still alive ?
why don ’ t you answer me , man ?
is that you , diomedes ?
draw your sword and give me enough blows to kill me .
most powerful lord , my mistress cleopatra sent me to you .
when did she send you ?
just now , my lord .
where is she ?
locked in her tomb .
she had a premonition of what has actually happened .
afraid that your anger would not subside , she sent you word she was dead .
too late , good diomedes .
call my guard , please .
hey out there !
carry me , good friends , to where cleopatra is .
it ’ s the last command i shall ever give you .
we ’ re very sorry , sir , that you may not live to wear us out with your commands .
it ’ s a very sad day .
no , my friends , don ’ t please fate by giving it your sorrow as well .
if we welcome our punishment , we punish it right back by seeming to take it lightly .
pick me up .
i have often led you , now you must carry me , my good friends — and take my thanks for everything .
oh , charmian , i will never leave this tomb !
be calm , dear lady .
no , i won ’ t .
strange and terrible events are all welcome , but i despise comforts .
the size of my sorrow must be as great as its source .
what ’ s the news !
is he dead ?
he is close to death , but not dead yet .
oh , antony , antony , antony !
help , charmian , help , iras , help !
be calm !
it was not caesar ’ s bravery that conquered antony but antony ’ s that has triumphed over himself .
that ’ s the way it should be — only antony should conquer antony .
no , our general ’ s infatuation is out of control .
his eyes used to glow with pride when he reviewed his troops .
his heart used to burst the buckles on his breastplate in great fights , but now he ’ s lost all temperance and dedicates his heart to satisfying the lust of an egyptian whore .
look at them .
take a good look , and you ’ ll see that one of the three men who rule the world has turned into a whore ’ s jester .
look and see .
if what you feel is really love , tell me how much .
it would be a pretty stingy love if it could be counted and calculated .
i want to measure the extent of your love , to see how far it stretches .
then you would have to go beyond heaven , beyond earth .
i have news from rome , my good lord .
i am dying , cleopatra , dying .
i just beg death to wait awhile , until i place the last of our many thousands of kisses on your lips .
i don ’ t dare come down — forgive me , my lord — i don ’ t dare , for fear of capture .
i will never be exhibited as lucky caesar ’ s prize .
if knives , poison , or snakes have edge , effect , or venom , i am safe from that fate .
your wife octavia , with her self-effacing eyes and self-righteous assumptions , won ’ t get any praise from patronizing me .
help us , good friends .
oh , quick , before i ’ m gone .
such exercise !
my lord is so heavy !
if i had the goddess juno ’ s power , i would make the strong-winged messenger , mercury , pick you up and seat you beside jove .
and welcome , welcome !
die where you have lived , in my arms .
if my lips had the power to give life , i would wear them out like this .
what a sad sight !
i am dying , cleopatra , dying .
give me some wine and let me say a few words .
i ’ ll trust my determination and my hands , but none of caesar ’ s men .
now i feel my soul leaving .
i can ’ t speak any more .
most noble man , will you die ?
don ’ t you care about me ?
shall i stay in this dreary world , which is no better than a pigsty without you ?
my lord !
oh , the glory of war has faded .
the flags have fallen .
young boys and girls are equal to men .
there is nothing distinctive , nothing remarkable left in the world .
our queen is dead too .
lady !
madam !
oh , madam , madam , madam !
royal egypt , empress !
quiet , quiet , iras .
now i am no more than a woman , ruled by the same lowly passion as the maid who milks and does the humblest chores .
now all is for nothing .
how are you , my ladies ?
cheer up !
how are you , charmian ?
my gallant girls !
good noble ladies , be brave .
we ’ ll bury him , and then we ’ ll commit acts as brave and fine as any romans , and make death proud to take us .
come on , you can go .
the container of that great soul is now cold .
ah , ladies , ladies !
let ’ s go .
we have no friends but determination and the quickest death .
tell him to surrender .
his position is hopeless .
right away , caesar .
what are you doing with a sword ?
who do you think you are coming in here armed ?
my name is decretus .
i served mark antony , who was the commander most worthy of my services .
while he was alive , i lived only to serve him and oppose his enemies .
if not , you can kill me .
what are you saying ?
caesar , i ’ m telling you that antony is dead .
when such a great man dies there should be a thunderclap .
the fractured world , in its confusion , should send lions into the city streets and humans into the wilderness to live in lions ’ dens .
this isn ’ t the death of one man .
it ’ s the death of half the world .
now , my dearest queen — please , stand farther away from me .
what ’ s the matter ?
i can see in your eyes there ’ s been some good news .
what , does your wife say you can come home ?
i wish she ’ d never let you come .
don ’ t let her say i kept you .
i have no power over you .
you belong to her .
the gods know — oh , never has a queen been so betrayed as i have been .
i knew from the first it would be this way .
cleopatra — how could i have ever thought that you would be faithful and true , even though your vows of love shook the heavens themselves — you , who were unfaithful to fulvia ?
it was wild insanity to believe promises made by the mouth and not the heart .
when you begged to stay , that was the time for words .
you didn ’ t want to go then !
you saw eternity in my lips and eyes , and happiness in the arch of my eyebrows .
my features are still that beautiful — or else you , the greatest soldier in the world , have become the greatest liar by overpraising them .
this is his sword .
i pulled it from his wound .
look — his noble blood is still on it .
listen , sad friends , though the gods may rebuke me , this news would make kings cry .
his faults were equally matched by his virtues .
but gods , you give us faults so we ’ ll be human .
caesar is upset .
either i had to ruin you , or you would have ruined me .
let me tell you , friends —
i ’ ll tell you at a better time .
this man looks like his business is urgent .
let ’ s hear what he has to say .
tell her to put her mind at rest .
she ’ ll find out soon enough by one of our messengers how respectfully and kindly we plan to treat her .
may the gods bless you .
come here , proculeius .
tell her we mean her no disrespect .
go , and hurry back to bring us her reply and news of her state of mind .
i will , caesar .
gallus , you go with him .
where ’ s dolabella ?
dolabella !
i remember he ’ s already occupied .
he ’ ll be done in time .
come and see the proof .
it ’ s pathetic to be caesar .
he can ’ t be fortune ; he ’ s only fortune ’ s errand boy .
caesar greets the queen of egypt and asks that you consider what you will ask from him .
what ’ s your name ?
my name is proculeius .
but i don ’ t worry about being deceived because i don ’ t need to trust .
if your master wants a queen to beg from him , you should tell him that a queen will beg for no less than a kingdom .
if he will grant me conquered egypt , so that i may give it to my son , i will kneel to him with thanks .
be content .
you ’ re in the charge of an honorable man .
don ’ t be afraid .
if i can tell him that you have submitted to him sweetly , he ’ ll request your assistance in finding ways in which he can support you .
please tell him i have surrendered to his fortune .
i ’ m learning every hour how to be subservient .
i ’ ll tell him all of this , dear lady .
be at ease .
your majesty !
oh , cleopatra !
stop , brave lady , stop !
we have not betrayed you .
what , am i being denied death , as well ?
don ’ t insult my master ’ s generosity by killing yourself .
your death would prevent that .
where are you , death ?
come here .
come , and you can have a queen .
oh , control yourself , lady !
let caesar do whatever he wants .
you ’ d better understand that i won ’ t wait till i ’ m chained up in your master ’ s court , and i won ’ t let myself be scolded even once by dull octavia .
shall i let them exhibit me to the shouting mobs of rome ?
i ’ d rather die in a ditch in egypt , and make it my gentle grave .
i ’ d rather lie in the nile mud with flies laying their eggs in me , making me disgusting .
i ’ d rather be hung in chains from one of our pyramids !
you ’ ll see that caesar is giving you no reason to do so .
proculeius , caesar has heard about what you ’ ve done here and has sent for you .
i ’ ll take the queen into my custody .
so be it , dolabella .
be kind to her .
have you heard of me , most noble empress ?
i don ’ t remember .
you must be the one who laughs when boys or women tell you their dreams .
isn ’ t that your habit ?
i don ’ t know what you mean , madam .
i dreamed about an emperor called antony .
oh , i wish i could sleep again , so i could have another dream like that !
when he raised his arm in command , the world trembled .
there was no end to his generosity .
kings and noblemen served him .
kingdoms and provinces dropped from his pockets like loose change .
cleopatra — do you think there ever was , or could there ever be , a man such as the one i dreamed about ?
no , gentle madam .
the gods can hear you lying !
antony would easily outshine all imaginary beings .
listen to me , madam .
you are a remarkable person and your loss is equally remarkable .
i hope i never achieve success if i don ’ t feel some of your heartbroken grief right now .
thank you , sir .
do you know what caesar intends to do with me ?
i ’ m reluctant to tell you what i wish you knew .
you need not kneel to me .
please rise , queen .
the gods have ordained it to be like this , sir .
don ’ t think i blame you .
i ’ ll leave you now .
you may do whatever you want in the world .
it ’ s yours , and you may hang us , your trophies of war , anywhere you like .
here , my good lord .
what do you mean , lady ?
i wish i were as big and strong as you .
listen to me , queen .
there is an emergency i must take care of , but my whole heart will remain here with you .
my italy is full of civil war .
sextus pompeius is sailing toward the port of rome .
but my personal motivation — and that which should move you most to sanction my departure — is that fulvia is dead .
is it possible fulvia is dead ?
she ’ s dead , my queen .
you shall advise me in everything having to do with cleopatra .
this is the inventory of the money , silverware , dishes , and jewels that are still in my possession .
not even trivial things were left out .
where ’ s seleucus ?
here , madam .
this is my treasurer .
my lord , he will swear on his life that i haven ’ t kept a thing . — tell the truth , seleucus .
madam , i ’ d rather sew my lips shut than tell a lie when my life depends upon it .
what did i keep for myself ?
enough to buy everything you have declared .
no , don ’ t be ashamed , cleopatra .
look around you , caesar .
oh , just see what happens after the pageantry is over !
seleucus ’ ingratitude makes me wild .
i ’ ll give you a good reason to cringe , i promise you .
i ’ ll scratch out your eyes , even if they could fly .
oh , that was unbelievably low !
cleopatra , our conquest won ’ t include either the things you kept back or the ones you listed .
it ’ s all still yours .
do whatever you like with it .
so cheer up .
no , dear queen .
eat and sleep .
i have so much care and pity for you that you could call me friend .
and so , good-bye .
my master and my lord !
not true .
good-bye .
but listen , charmian .
it ’ s time to end it , good lady .
i will , madam .
where ’ s the queen ?
look , sir .
dolabella .
make the best use of this information you can .
i have done your bidding and fulfilled my promise .
dolabella , i will always be in debt to you .
and i your servant .
good-bye , good queen .
i must go attend caesar .
farewell , and thanks .
now , iras , what do you think ?
you will be exhibited in rome along with me , like egyptian puppets .
crude slaves with greasy aprons , rulers , and hammers shall lift us up so everyone can see .
the gods forbid !
no , it ’ s certain , iras .
insolent oh , the good gods !
no , that ’ s the truth .
i ’ ll never see it .
i know my nails are stronger than my eyes ; i ’ ll scratch them out .
why , that ’ s just the way to frustrate their plans and defeat their absurd intentions .
now , charmian !
women , dress me like a queen .
go get my best clothes .
what ’ s that noise ?
there ’ s a farmer here who won ’ t leave without seeing your highness .
he has brought you figs .
let him come in .
what a poor instrument , that can do such a noble deed !
he brings me freedom .
there ’ s nothing of the weak woman left in me .
now from head to foot i ’ m as firm as marble .
now the inconstant moon has nothing to do with me .
this is the man .
leave us .
do you have in there the pretty snake of the nile that kills without pain ?
i certainly do have him , but i wouldn ’ t advise you to touch him .
people who die of it seldom or never recover .
do you remember anyone who died of it ?
many people , men and women alike .
indeed , she gives a very good testimony of the snake ’ s power .
but if you believe everything they say , you won ’ t be saved by half of what they do .
but this is a sure thing : the snake ’ s an odd snake .
i hope you are pleased with the snake .
farewell .
you must know that the snake will act according to his nature .
yes , yes .
farewell .
there isn ’ t any kindness in the snake .
good .
will it eat me ?
don ’ t think i ’ m so dumb that i don ’ t know that the devil himself won ’ t eat a woman .
well , you can go now .
farewell .
give me my robe .
put on my crown .
i long to be immortal .
quickly , quickly , good iras , quickly .
i think i hear antony call me .
i see him revive himself to praise my noble act .
i hear him mock caesar ’ s luck , which the gods give to men in order to balance out their subsequent wrath .
now let my courage prove my title as wife .
so , are you done ?
come then , kiss me and take the last bit of warmth from my lips .
good-bye , kind charmian .
iras , i won ’ t see you again for a long time .
do i have the asp ’ s poison on my lips ?
did you fall ?
if you can leave your body so easily , then the touch of death is like a lover ’ s pinch , which hurts but is desired .
do you lie still ?
if you leave like that , you tell the world that it ’ s not worthy of a good-bye .
clouds , dissolve into rain , so that i could say the gods themselves are weeping !
separate me from life with your sharp teeth .
poor poisonous fool , be angry and bite .
oh , if you could speak , i might hear you call caesar an ass who ’ s been outsmarted !
oh , eastern star !
quiet , quiet !
don ’ t you see my baby suckling at my breast so that its nurse will fall asleep ?
the poison is as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle — oh , antony ! — no , i ’ ll take you too .
why should i stay — in this vile world ?
so , good-bye .
now , death , you can boast that you have an incomparable girl in your possession .
close , soft eyes .
the sun will never be seen by such royal eyes again .
your crown is crooked .
i ’ ll straighten it , then play — where ’ s the queen ?
speak softly .
don ’ t wake her .
caesar has sent — too slow a messenger .
oh , come quickly !
i almost feel you .
there ’ s dolabella , who was sent from caesar .
call him .
what kind of work is this , charmian ?
is this well done ?
it is well done , and appropriate for a princess who has descended from so many royal kings .
ah , soldier !
what ’ s going on in here ?
they ’ re all dead .
caesar , you thought this would happen .
you ’ re coming here yourself to see the dreaded act you had tried to stop .
oh , unfaithful lover !
stop arguing and listen to my plans .
whether i go ahead with them or not is completely up to you .
i swear by the sun that when i leave here , it will be as your faithful servant .
cut my corset laces , charmian , so i can breathe .
hurry !
just as antony loves .
control yourself , my precious queen , and concede that my love is true .
that ’ s what fulvia told me .
i beg you , turn away and cry for her .
then say good-bye to me and tell me those tears were for my benefit .
oh , sir , you are too good at predicting the future .
what you were afraid of has happened .
how did they die ?
i don ’ t see any blood .
who was with them last ?
a simple country farmer who brought her figs .
this was the basket .
they were poisoned , then .
oh , caesar , this charmian lived until a moment ago .
she stood and spoke .
i found her adjusting the crown on her dead mistress .
she stood trembling , then suddenly dropped dead .
oh , noble weakness !
here on her breast there ’ s a little bloody mark .
there ’ s a similar mark on her arm .
this is an asp ’ s trail , and these fig leaves have slime on them , just like the kind that asps deposit on the caves by the nile .
pick up her bed and carry her ladies out of the tomb .
she shall be buried next to her antony .
no other grave on earth shall hold a pair this famous .
our army shall somberly attend this funeral and then depart for rome .
come , dolabella .
you ’ ll make me angry .
no more of this .
i know you can do better than that , but it ’ ll do for now .
i swear by my sword — swear by your shield , too !
i ’ ll leave you , lady .
polite sir , let me say one thing .
sir , you and i must part company — no , that ’ s not it .
it ’ s difficult to have such immaturity so close to my heart , but bear with me .
even the traits that become me most kill me when you don ’ t approve of them .
your honor is the reason you are leaving .
may the gods be with you .
may your sword be victorious and everything you do succeed .
let ’ s go .
come with me .
our imminent separation so occupies our thoughts that even though you stay here , you come with me , and even though i leave here , i stay with you .
you ’ re too forgiving .
if he ’ s been spending his leisure time in lustful pursuits , then he ’ ll be punished with venereal diseases , and that ’ s his business .
here ’ s more news .
pompey has a strong navy .
i should have known it .
it ’ s been this way ever since the first government was organized .
caesar , i have news about menecrates and menas , notorious pirates who prowl the sea in a variety of ships .
they ’ ve made many raids upon italy — and the naval patrols go pale at even the thought of resisting them .
antony , it ’ s time to stop your wild hedonism .
and even though you were brought up as a gentleman , you patiently tolerated more hardships than savages could withstand .
you drank horses ’ urine and water from scum-covered puddles that even animals would refuse .
it ’ s too bad .
let ’ s hope his sense of shame will send him back to rome quickly .
it ’ s time that we brought our armies into the field .
pompey is making the most of our absence .
tomorrow , caesar , i ’ ll be able to tell you what land and sea forces i can raise for this war .
i ’ ll be getting my own figures together in the meantime .
good-bye .
good-bye , my lord .
charmian !
madam ?
so i can sleep away the time while my antony is gone .
you think about him too much .
that ’ s treason !
i hope not , madam .
what can i do for your highness ?
i don ’ t want to hear you sing .
i ’ m not interested in anything a eunuch can do .
it ’ s a good thing for you that , being castrated , you can better concentrate on my needs .
do you have desires ?
yes , dear madam .
indeed ?
well , not in deed , madam , since i can ’ t do anything unchaste .
is he standing or sitting ?
or is he walking ?
or is he on his horse ?
oh , how fortunate that horse is to have antony on him .
he ’ s speaking now , or perhaps he ’ s whispering , “ where ’ s my serpent of the nile ? ” for that ’ s his pet name for me .
i ’ m killing myself with this provocative speculation . . .
are you thinking about me ?
no , listen to it , antony .
perhaps what , my love ?
maybe ?
no , most likely .
you can ’ t stay here any longer .
call in the messengers and we ’ ll find out .
as surely as i am the queen of egypt , antony , you ’ re blushing , which means you ’ re caesar ’ s servant .
call the messengers !
queen of egypt , greetings !
you are nothing like mark antony !
but since you come from him , you ’ re saturated with his healing spirit .
how does it go with my magnificent mark antony ?
the last thing he did before sending me off , dear queen , was to kiss — the last of many such kisses — this indian pearl for you .
my ear must pull it out .
good friend , ” he said , “ say that the faithful roman sends an oyster ’ s treasure to the great queen of egypt , and that he plans to enhance this meager gift by adding new kingdoms to her empire .
tell her that the entire east shall call her queen . ” then he nodded and solemnly mounted an armored warhorse , which neighed so loudly it effectively silenced anything i might have said in reply .
was he sad or happy ?
he was like that time of year halfway between the extremes of hot and cold : he was neither sad nor happy .
just notice .
he wasn ’ t sad , because he knows that his disposition affects others .
he was somewhere in the middle , between them . . .
oh , heavenly mixture !
whether you are sad or merry , the intensity of either suits you like no one else . . .
yes , madam , twenty different messengers .
why did you send so many ?
whoever is born on a day i forget to send a message to antony will die a beggar .
bring ink and paper , charmian .
welcome , my good alexas .
charmian , did i ever love caesar as much as this ?
oh , that splendid caesar !
may you choke on any other sentiments like that !
say , “ that splendid antony . ” the courageous caesar !
by isis , i ’ ll give you bloody teeth if you ever compare caesar with antony , my best man among men .
pardon me , but i ’ m just repeating what you yourself have said .
that was when i was young and inexperienced and didn ’ t know what passion was .
in that case , the wise gods deny our prayers for our own good .
i ’ ll do well .
the people are on my side , and i ’ m in charge of the sea .
my forces are growing , and everything i know tells me it ’ s all coming together .
mark antony is at dinner in egypt and won ’ t be going outside to make war .
caesar loses supporters wherever he raises money .
lepidus flatters both of them , as they flatter him , but he doesn ’ t love them , and they don ’ t love him .
caesar and lepidus are organizing their military operation .
they have a massive army .
where did you hear this ?
it ’ s not true .
from silvius , sir .
he ’ s dreaming .
i know they ’ re in rome together , hoping for antony to return .
lecherous cleopatra , may all the charms of love soften those withered lips !
join your witchcraft with your beauty , and let antony ’ s lust combine with both .
keep this libertine occupied with endless debauchery .
this news is absolutely true : mark antony is expected to arrive in rome at any hour now .
in the time since he left egypt , he could have traveled an even longer distance .
his military ability is double that of the other two .
we must form a better opinion of ourselves if our uprising can pull the insatiable antony ’ s attention away from that egyptian widow .
i don ’ t expect caesar and antony will have a very friendly reunion .
menas , i don ’ t understand how minor quarrels can be superseded by greater ones .
it will be as the gods see fit .
in any case , our survival depends on putting together the strongest force possible .
let ’ s go , menas .
good enobarbus , you would be doing a very good thing if you advised your captain to speak calmly and quietly .
i will advise him to speak as he usually does .
by jupiter , if i were antony , i wouldn ’ t shave my beard today .
this is not the time for dwelling on personal grievances .
but major issues must come before minor ones .
not if the minor ones come up first .
here comes the noble antony .
and there comes caesar .
you ’ re right .
if we were in front of our armies , about to fight , i would do this .
welcome to rome .
thank you .
have a seat .
after you .
no , after you .
caesar , what did my stay in egypt have to do with you ?
no more than my staying here in rome might mean to you in egypt .
but if you conspired against my position while you were there , i might be interested in the reason for your stay in egypt .
how do you mean , “ conspired ” ?
you can judge for yourself what i mean .
your wife and brother led troops against me , claiming to be fighting in your name .
they said they were acting for you .
you ’ re mistaken .
my brother didn ’ t use my name to justify his rebellion .
he rejected my authority as much as yours .
i ’ ve already sent the proof in my letters .
if you want to pick a fight , you ’ ll have to find a more substantial excuse .
you defend yourself by blaming my judgment , but you ’ re just making up feeble excuses .
not true , not true .
you know i would never approve a war against my own cause .
as for my wife , if only you had such a wife .
it ’ s easier to rule a third of the world than a wife like that .
but you can ’ t blame me for her offenses .
i sent you a letter while you were carousing in alexandria .
i was not myself , as a result of the wine .
the next day i explained all this to him , which was as good as begging his pardon .
let ’ s not fight over this fellow .
meet with the ambassadors .
tonight we ’ ll wander through the streets and observe the people .
you will never be able to say the same about me .
go on , caesar .
what part of the agreement did i break ?
you agreed to send me troops and weapons when i needed them .
you refused me both .
i overlooked your request , but i did not deny it .
your request came at a time when the poisonous effects of reveling caused me to be unaware of my own actions .
spoken like a gentleman .
if it ’ s okay with you , you should not press your grievances any further , but realize that the current situation should be enough to reconcile you .
well put , maecenas .
or you can pretend to settle your differences until this matter with pompey is finished .
you can argue as much as you like when there ’ s nothing else to do .
you are only a soldier .
don ’ t speak any further .
as you please .
may i speak , caesar .
what is it , agrippa ?
you have a beautiful half-sister , octavia .
great mark antony is a widower now .
you ’ d better not make that suggestion , agrippa .
if cleopatra heard you , you would be well punished for your audacity .
it ’ s true i ’ m not married , caesar .
let me hear what agrippa has to say .
with this marriage , all the petty jealousies that now seem huge , and all the great fears that are dangerous in themselves , would disappear .
since she would love both of you , you two would be joined in that love .
what do you say , caesar ?
he has both my power and my influence over octavia .
i wouldn ’ t dream of opposing such an obviously promising idea .
here ’ s my hand .
i give you a sister whom i love more than a brother ever loved any sister .
she will be the bond that joins our kingdoms and our hearts .
i ’ m happy to say “ amen ” to that !
i didn ’ t think i would ever fight pompey .
there isn ’ t much time .
either we go after pompey or he ’ ll come after us .
where is he now ?
near how large is his land army ?
large and increasing .
but his navy rules the sea .
that ’ s what i hear .
come with us , lepidus .
noble antony , even illness couldn ’ t keep me away .
good enobarbus !
we can be happy that things have been resolved so agreeably .
and i see you survived your time in egypt .
we heard that once you were served eight wild boars roasted whole for breakfast — for only twelve people !
is that true ?
that was nothing .
there were many even more memorable feasts .
she ’ s a remarkable lady , if the rumors are to be believed .
i ’ ll tell you .
the sails were dyed purple , and they were perfumed so heavily that they made the air seem dizzy with love .
the oars were made of silver , and the oarsmen rowed in time to flute music .
pretty , cupid-like boys stood on either side of her , smiling and cooling her with multicolored fans , which seemed to fan the flames in her cheeks even as they cooled them , undoing what they did .
how excellent for antony !
when she landed at the port , antony sent an invitation for her to come to supper .
she replied by saying that it would be better for him to be her guest instead .
royal seductress !
now antony has to leave her completely .
age won ’ t wither her , and her charms are so varied that she never grows boring .
even her worst faults are charming , and holy priests bless her even when she acts the slut .
let ’ s go .
good enobarbus , consider yourself my guest as long as you ’ re here .
i humbly thank you .
and i will spend our time apart on my knees , praying for you .
good night .
tell me why , if you can .
but you had better get back to egypt again .
tell me who shall have the better luck , caesar or me ?
caesar .
so you ’ d better not stay with him , antony .
your guardian angel is noble , courageous , significant , and unmatched when caesar ’ s not around .
but when you are with him , your angel is weakened and easily frightened .
that ’ s why there must be space between you .
have a good night !
don ’ t speak of this again .
to none but you , only to you .
with his natural luck , he will beat you even against the odds .
your light dulls when he is near .
leave now .
tell ventidius i want to speak with him .
come here , ventidius .
you must go to parthia .
your authorization is ready .
come with me and i ’ ll get it for you .
don ’ t spend any more time here .
go tell your generals to hurry their preparations .
sir , we ’ ll follow as soon as mark antony kisses octavia good-bye .
good-bye then , until the time i see you dressed in your battle gear , which will suit you both very well .
you ’ re taking a shorter route .
my plans take me a roundabout way .
you ’ ll get there two days before me .
good luck , sir .
farewell .
play me some music .
music feeds the melancholy moods of us lovers .
musicians , come in !
never mind .
let ’ s play billiards .
play with me , charmian .
my arm is sore .
i ’ ll do my best , madam .
i don ’ t want to play now .
give me my fishing rod .
we ’ ll go to the river .
with my music playing in the background , i ’ ll lure fish .
cram your good news into my ears .
madam , madam — antony ’ s dead !
if you say that , you bastard , you ’ ll kill your queen .
kings have trembled to kiss this hand .
let me say first , madam , that he is well .
well then , here ’ s more money for you .
but you know , sirrah , we customarily say that the dead are well .
if that ’ s what you mean , i ’ ll melt this gold and pour it down your throat that speaks these hateful words .
good madam , let me speak .
all right , i will .
but you don ’ t look as if you bring good news .
if you really are sir rowland ’ s son , as you ’ ve just whispered to me — and i can absolutely see the likeness in your face — you are truly welcome here .
i am the duke who loved your father .
come to my cave and tell me the rest of your story . — good old man , you are as welcome here as your master is .
give him your arm .
give me your hand , and explain your situation to me .
you haven ’ t seen him since ?
sir , sir , that can ’ t be true .
if i weren ’ t a merciful man , i ’ d forget about your missing brother and punish you in his place .
but do this : find your brother , wherever he is .
bring him here dead or alive within the next year , or get out off my land .
i ’ m seizing your lands and all that you possess until your brother gives testimony that absolves you of any guilt .
i wish your highness knew my true feelings in this matter : i have never in my life loved my brother .
that makes you an even bigger villain . — well , throw him out , and have my officers seize his house and lands .
do this immediately , and send him packing .
hang there on this tree , you lines of poetry , and bear witness to my love .
and you , and how are you liking the shepherd ’ s life , master touchstone ?
well , in and of itself , it is a good life , but given that it ’ s a shepherd ’ s life , it ’ s worthless .
in the fact that it ’ s solitary , i enjoy it very much ; but in the sense that it ’ s private , it ’ s terrible .
now , i ’ m very pleased with it being outdoors , but in its not being at the court , it is boring .
are you any kind of philosopher yourself , shepherd ?
you ’ re a natural-born philosopher !
were you ever at court , shepherd ?
honestly , no .
then you are damned .
i hope not .
explain .
well , if you were never at court , you were never exposed to good manners ; if you never witnessed good manners , your manners must be wicked ; wickedness is a sin , and committing sins leads to damnation .
you are in a perilous state , shepherd .
not at all , touchstone .
the good manners of the court look as silly in the country as country behavior is laughable at the court .
you told me that you don ’ t salute at the court but kiss hands .
now , if courtiers were shepherds , that kind of courtesy would be unclean .
give a quick example .
come , explain .
why , because we ’ re always handling our ewes , and their fleece , as you know , is greasy .
what , don ’ t courtiers ' hands sweat ?
and isn ’ t a sheep ’ s grease as wholesome as a man ’ s sweat ?
that ’ s a poor example .
a better example — come on .
besides , our hands are hard and calloused .
then your lips will feel them more quickly .
come on .
you worthless man !
you are about as much of a thinker as worm ’ s meat is a nice steak .
learn from the wise , and comprehend : the courtier ’ s perfume is made from cat discharge — much more disgusting than tar .
fix your example , shepherd .
your wit is too courtly for me .
i ’ ll rest now .
good morning , sir .
can you tell me whether rosalind , duke senior ’ s daughter , has also been banished ?
where will the old duke live ?
you ’ re going to rest while you ’ re still damned ?
god help you , foolish man .
pray god does some surgery on you : you need to be fixed .
here comes young mr. ganymede , my new mistress ’ s brother .
there is no jewel like rosalind .
her worth is carried on the wind and it blows throughout the world , carrying the name of rosalind .
all the most beautiful paintings are black when compared to rosalind .
don ’ t think of any beauty but the beauty of rosalind .
i could rhyme like that for eight years in a row , excepting meal times and sleeping hours .
that awful , plodding rhyme sounded like a row of dairy women stomping off to market .
oh , stop , fool .
let me try : if there ’ s a buck who needs a doe tell him rosalind will do .
a cat in heat will look for a mate , and rosalind certainly will too .
winter garments need to be filled with something , and so does skinny rosalind .
after you harvest , you have to sheaf and bind so throw ripe rosalind on the harvest cart .
the sweetest nut has the sourest rind and rosalind is that kind of nut .
the man who finds the sweetest rose will be pricked by it , and by rosalind .
this is exactly the false way that verses gallop along .
why bother with them ?
quiet , you stupid fool .
i found them on a tree .
well , the tree bears rotten fruit .
all right , you ’ ve had your say , but we ’ ll let the forest judge whether or not you spoke wisely .
quiet !
but on the prettiest branches or at the end of every sentence i ’ ll write “ rosalinda , ” teaching everyone who can read that the essence of every spirit is contained in this one woman .
heaven commanded nature to fill her one body with all the graces that women contain .
nature took helen ’ s cleopatra ’ s majesty , the best of atalanta , and unhappy lucretia ’ s modesty .
so , by heaven ’ s decree , rosalind was composed of different faces , eyes , and hearts , so that she might have the most prized touches of all .
heaven wanted rosalind to have these gifts and me to live and die as her slave .
were you listening to these verses ?
oh yes , i heard them all , and more , too .
some of those lines had more feet than the that ’ s not a problem : the feet can bear sure , but these feet were
but did you listen to all that poetry without even wondering about what your name is doing on all these trees ?
was it a man ?
and he had a chain that once belonged to you hanging around his neck .
are you blushing ?
please , who ?
it ’ s difficult to bring two friends together , but even mountains can be moved together by earthquakes .
no , who are you talking about ?
is it possible ?
no , i ’ m begging you now , tell me who it is .
oh , this is wonderful , wonderful — just wonderful wonderful !
good grief , do you think that just because i ’ m dressed like a man , i have a man ’ s patience ?
every second you delay is as long and dull as a journey to south seas .
i ’ m begging you , tell me who it is quickly , and speak fast .
i wish you could just stammer this hidden man out of your mouth like wine out of a narrow-necked bottle : either too much at once or none at all .
i ’ m begging you , take the cork out of your mouth so i can drink the news .
so you want to put a man in your belly .
did god make him ?
i mean , what sort of man is he ?
is he enough of a man to wear a hat and grow a beard ?
no , he has only a little beard .
well , eventually god will send him some more hair , if he thanks him .
i ’ ll wait till his beard grows in , if you ’ ll just hurry up and tell me what chin that beard is on .
it ’ s orlando , who triumphed over both the wrestler and you in the same instant .
damn you for mocking me .
really , cousin , it ’ s him .
orlando ?
orlando .
what did he do when you saw him ?
what did he say ?
how did he look ?
where did he go ?
what brings him here ?
did he ask about me ?
where is he staying ?
how did he say good-bye ?
and when will you see him again ?
answer me in a word .
you ’ d better get me but does he know that i ’ m here in the forest and dressed in men ’ s clothing ?
does he look as bright and handsome as the day we saw him wrestling ?
but taste my story , and relish it by paying attention .
i found orlando under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
that tree could be called god ’ s tree , since it drops such wonderful fruit .
let me talk , good lady .
go on .
he lay there , stretched out like a wounded knight .
though that must have been a pitiful sight , the ground looked beautiful .
cry , “ whoa ! ” to your tongue , please .
it ’ s leaping about like a frisky horse .
he was dressed like a hunter .
oh , that ’ s ominous !
he has come to kill my heart .
i ’ d like to sing my song solo .
you ’ re making me go off-key .
don ’ t you know that i ’ m a woman ?
whatever i think , i have to say .
sweetheart , go on .
quiet !
isn ’ t that him heading this way ?
that ’ s him .
thanks for your company but , really , i would have preferred being alone .
me too , but still , for the sake of good manners , i ’ ll say thanks for your company .
goodbye .
let ’ s meet as little as we can .
i also hope that we can be better strangers .
please don ’ t ruin any more trees by carving love poems on their barks .
please don ’ t ruin any more of my poems by reading them so badly .
your love ’ s name is rosalind ?
yes , that ’ s it .
i don ’ t like her name .
how tall is she ?
just as tall as my heart .
you ’ re sure full of smooth answers .
your worst fault is being in love .
well , it ’ s a fault i wouldn ’ t trade for your best virtue .
i ’ m tired of you .
there i ’ ll see only myself .
which is either a fool or a nothing .
i ’ m not going to waste any more time with you .
goodbye , good mr. love .
i ’ m glad to see you go .
adieu , good mr. depression .
very well .
what do you want ?
you should ask me what time of day it is , instead .
there ’ s no clock here in the forest .
then there must be no lovers in the forest , either , because they ’ re as good as a clock , marking the lazy foot of time with a sigh every minute and a groan every hour .
indeed i do , sir , and i ’ ve come to let you in on a certain problem .
i ’ ve been informed by certain sources i can ’ t disclose that your younger brother orlando plans to fight me in disguise .
tomorrow , sir , i ’ m fighting for my reputation , and any man who gets away without a broken bone or two is an exceptional wrestler indeed .
your brother is young and inexperienced , and because of my affection for you , i ’ d hate to crush him — though i ’ d have to , if he challenged me .
charles , i thank you for your loyalty to me , and you ’ ll see that i ’ ll reward you .
i ’ d heard about my brother ’ s plan and have been subtly trying to change his mind , but he ’ s determined .
i tell you , charles , he ’ s the stubbornest young fellow in france : overly ambitious , jealous of other people ’ s good qualities , and a traitor against me , his own blood brother .
so use your discretion .
i ’ d be just as happy if you broke his neck as his finger .
but if i really laid him bare , i ’ d have to weep and hang my head , and you would not believe me , his behavior is so shocking .
why didn ’ t you say “ the swift steps ” of time instead of the “ lazy foot ” ?
wouldn ’ t that have been just as appropriate ?
no , not at all , sir .
time travels at different speeds for different people .
i can tell you who time strolls for , who it trots for , who it gallops for , and who it stops cold for .
okay , who does it trot for ?
who does time amble for ?
time ambles for both men .
who does it gallop for ?
who does it stand still for ?
for lawyers on vacation , because they sleep their holidays away , with no sense of how time moves .
where do you live , pretty young man ?
were you born here ?
just like the rabbit , who lives where she is born .
your speech is more refined than i would expect in such a remote place as this .
many people have told me so .
actually , an old religious uncle of mine taught me how to speak , and he was brought up in the city .
thank god i ’ m not a woman and afflicted with all the giddiness that troubles that entire sex .
what were the primary evils he claimed women were guilty of ?
there were no primary ones .
please , tell me some of them .
no , i won ’ t give my medicine away to anyone but the sick .
there ’ s a man haunting this forest who abuses the trees by carving “ rosalind ” on their barks .
well , i ’ m the man you ’ re speaking of .
please , tell me your cure .
but you don ’ t have any of the symptoms my uncle told me about .
he taught me how to recognize a man in love , and you ’ re not a prisoner of love , i ’ m sure .
what did he say the symptoms were ?
your stockings should be falling down around your ankles , your hat flying off your head , your sleeves unbuttoned , your shoes untied , and everything about you demonstrating carelessness and misery .
but you ’ re no such man .
you ’ re so neat and well put-together that you look like you love yourself more than anyone else .
young boy , i wish i could make you believe that i ’ m in love .
make me believe it ?
but really , are you the one who ’ s been hanging on the trees those poems that speak so admiringly of rosalind ?
i swear to you by rosalind ’ s own pretty hand that i am that unfortunate man .
are you really as in love as your poems declare ?
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much i love her .
but i promise it can be cured with some guidance .
have you ever cured anyone this way before ?
yes , one , and this is how i did it .
i don ’ t want to be cured , boy .
i could cure you , if you just called me rosalind and came by my cottage every day to woo me .
by my faith in love , i will , then .
tell me where you live .
come with me , i ’ ll show you , and along the way , you can tell me where you live .
will you come ?
wholeheartedly , good young man .
no , you have to call me rosalind . — sister , you ’ re coming ?
come on , sweet audrey .
i ’ ll get your goats , audrey .
do my simple features please you ?
your features , god help us !
what features ?
really , audrey , i wish you were more poetical .
i don ’ t know what “ poetical ” means .
is it “ chaste in word and action ” ?
does it mean being truthful ?
not really , for the truest poetry is often the most artificial .
but you still wish the gods had made me poetical ?
i do , in fact .
right now you swear to me that you are a virgin ; if you were a poet , i might have some hope you were lying .
what , you don ’ t want me to be chaste ?
not really , unless you were ugly .
well , i ’ m not beautiful , so i hope that i can at least be chaste .
i ’ m not a slut — i keep myself clean — but i thank god i am ugly .
well , praise the lord you ’ re ugly .
well , god bless this marriage !
amen .
well , that ’ s what the wife brings to the marriage .
horns ?
well , there they are .
only for poor men ?
no , no .
the nobleman ’ s are as huge as the underfed villager ’ s .
is the single man lucky , then ?
no .
just as a town protected by a wall around it is worth more than a low-lying village , a married man ’ s horned forehead is more honorable than a bachelor ’ s bare forehead .
here comes sir oliver .
will you marry us here , under this tree , or should we follow you to your chapel ?
is there anyone to give the bride away ?
i don ’ t want to take another man ’ s second-hand goods .
no , someone has to give her away or the marriage isn ’ t legal .
how are you , sir ?
we ’ re glad to see you .
god bless you for being here .
i ’ m very glad to see you .
this is just a trifling matter here , sir .
no , no , put your hat back on .
do you want to get married , fool ?
just as the ox has his yoke , the horse its bridle , the falcon a tether , a man has his desires — to keep in check .
and , being a man of your breeding , you ’ re going to be married under some shrubs like a beggar ?
get yourself to a church and have a proper priest , who can tell you what marriage is all about , marry you .
then one of you will warp and pull away — and there goes your marriage .
come with me and let me advise you .
come , sweet audrey .
we have to be married properly .
none of these deranged rascals can shake me from my profession .
don ’ t talk to me .
i ’ m going to cry .
go ahead if you want , but remember that crying doesn ’ t suit a man .
but don ’ t i have good reason to cry ?
as good a reason as any .
so go ahead and cry .
his kiss is as holy as bread blessed by a priest .
i ’ m very glad i came to see you .
if he shows up tomorrow , i ’ ll give him what ’ s coming to him .
if he can manage to walk after our fight , i ’ ll never wrestle for money again .
farewell , my lord .
but not for long ; charles will take care of everything .
but you heard him swear up and down that he was .
he ’ s staying in the forest with your father now .
i met my father in the woods yesterday and had a long conversation with him .
he laughed at that and let me go .
he writes brave poems , speaks brave words , makes brave promises , and then breaks them just as bravely .
he ’ s like a cowardly
who ’ s coming here ?
mistress and master , you ’ ve often asked about that lovelorn shepherd you once saw me sitting with , the one who complained about the disdainful shepherdess he was in love with .
yes , what about him ?
sweet phoebe , do not scorn me .
do not , phoebe .
go ahead and say you don ’ t love me , but not so bitterly .
faint , fall down — if you don ’ t , then you ’ re lying about my eyes being murderers .
come on , show me the wound that my eyes have caused .
but my eyes , which i ’ ve darted at you , haven ’ t even left a mark .
now i am sure that eyes can ’ t hurt a person .
oh , darling phoebe , if you ever fall in love with some fresh face , then you ’ ll know about the invisible wounds that love ’ s sharp arrows can make .
well , until that time , don ’ t come near me .
and when that time comes , then you can mock me , but please don ’ t pity me , because i won ’ t pity you .
but mistress , know yourself .
get down on your knees and thank heaven for sending you such a good man .
ask this man ’ s forgiveness , love him , and accept his offer .
so take her , shepherd , and god bless you .
besides , i don ’ t like you .
come on , sister .
and don ’ t be proud .
the whole world could look at you , and no one would be as blind as he is , thinking you ’ re beautiful .
sweet phoebe , have pity on me .
well , i ’ m sorry for you , gentle silvius .
then both my grief and your sorrow will be cured .
you have my friendship .
isn ’ t that enough ?
i want you .
well , that ’ s just greedy .
but don ’ t expect any more than that .
do you know the boy who was just speaking to me ?
not very well , but i ’ ve met him several times .
don ’ t think i ’ m in love with him just because i ’ m asking about him .
but what do i care about words ?
and yet , words are a good thing when the man speaking them is pleasant to listen to .
he ’ s awfully proud , but his pride suits him .
he ’ ll grow up to be a proper man .
he ’ s not very tall , but he ’ s tall enough for his age .
his legs aren ’ t great , but they ’ re alright .
his lips were nice and red , a little more lively and passionate than the red that was in his cheeks — one was pure red and the other more pink .
what right did he have to scold me like that ?
he said my eyes and my hair were black and , now that i think of it , he scorned me .
i ’ m surprised i didn ’ t bite back .
but no matter — i ’ ll get back at him soon enough .
i ’ ll write him a taunting letter , and you can deliver it .
will you do that for me , silvius ?
with all my heart , phoebe .
i ’ ll be bitter toward him , and curt .
come with me , silvius .
please , pretty young man , i ’ d like to get to know you better .
they say you are a melancholy fellow .
i am .
i like it better than laughing .
people who are either too serious or too silly are awful .
well , i think it ’ s good to be serious and keep quiet .
in that case it ’ s good to be a post .
you ’ re a traveler .
well then , you have good reason to be sad .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ve sold your own land to see other men ’ s .
to have seen much but own nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
not true .
and your experience makes you sad .
i ’ d rather have a jester to make me happy than experience to make me sad — and to travel for all that trouble , no less !
good day and happiness to you , darling rosalind .
my beautiful rosalind , i ’ m only an hour late .
please , rosalind , my sweet cousin — be happy .
dear celia — i already look much happier than i feel , but you want me to look even happier ?
unless you can also teach me how to forget my banished father , you shouldn ’ t try to teach me how to be happy .
well , by this i can see that you don ’ t love me as much as i love you .
if well , i ’ ll just forget the difficulties of my situation , in order to focus on the happiness of yours .
i swear i will , and if i ever break my promise let me turn into a monster .
so please , my sweet rose , my dear rose , be happy .
from now on i will , cousin , and i ’ ll think of all kinds of games for us .
let me see — what do you think about falling in love ?
you ’ d break a date with your beloved by a whole hour ?
forgive me , darling rosalind .
no , if you ’ re ever late like this again , i ’ ll refuse to see you .
i ’ d rather be wooed by a snail .
a snail ?
besides , he brings his fate with him .
what fate is that ?
why , his cuckold ’ s horns , of course — the kind you men are always blaming on your wives .
see , the snail already has its horns , which prevents nasty rumors from spreading about his wife ’ s infidelity .
a virtuous woman won ’ t give her husband horns , and my rosalind is definitely virtuous .
and i am your rosalind .
come on , woo me , woo me .
i ’ m in a good mood now and likely to give you what you want .
what would you say to me now if i really were your precious little rosalind ?
i ’ d kiss you before i spoke .
no , it would be better to speak first and kiss only after you ’ ve run out of things to say .
when good orators finish talking , they spit ; when lovers do ( god help us if they ever do ) , they kiss .
what if she won ’ t kiss me ?
who could be out of things to say if he were with the girl he loves ?
indeed , you would be out if i were your mistress — if my chastity is worth as much as my wit .
aren ’ t i your rosalind ?
i like to pretend you are , because then it ’ s almost like actually talking to her .
no , you won ’ t die yourself , but only by proxy .
this world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time not one man has ever actually died from love .
then love me , rosalind .
okay , i will — on fridays and saturdays , and the rest .
and will you have me ?
sure , and twenty others just like you .
what ’ s that ?
well , aren ’ t you a good man ?
i hope so .
and can a person ever have too much of a good thing ? — come on , sister , you can be the priest and marry us . — give me your hand , orlando . — what do you say , sister ?
please , marry us .
i do .
okay , but when ?
right now ; as fast as she can say the vows .
then you have to say , “ i take you , rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife . ” i take you , rosalind , to be my lawfully wedded wife .
maybe i should ask you what right you have to take me , but i ’ ll take you , orlando , to be my husband .
so do all thoughts .
they have wings .
now tell me how long you intend to keep her .
forever and a day .
no , orlando , men are like april when they ’ re wooing a girl — young , and passionate — but like december once they ’ re married and their passions have cooled .
i ’ ll be more jealous of you than a wild rooster over his hen ; more noisy than a parrot chattering about the rain ; more fond of new things than an ape ; more giddy about getting what i want than a monkey .
i ’ ll cry at nothing , and i ’ ll always do it when you ’ re in a good mood .
and when you want to go to sleep , i ’ ll be up laughing like a hyena .
but will my rosalind do this , too ?
but she is wise .
right .
the wiser the woman , the wilder .
if you close the doors on a woman ’ s wit , it ’ ll fly out the window .
if you shut the windows , it will pour out the keyhole .
if you stop up the keyhole , it will escape from the chimney along with the smoke .
a man with a wife like that might ask , “ hey , wandering wit , where are you off to ? ” nah , better save the questions for when you find her in your neighbor ’ s bed .
you ’ ll never find her without an answer unless you find her without a tongue .
a woman who doesn ’ t know how to make her own indiscretions look like her husband ’ s fault is hardly a woman .
rosalind , i have to leave you for two hours .
i must join the duke for lunch .
i ’ ll be back here with you by two o 'clock .
oh , go , leave me .
i knew you ’ d turn out this way .
my friends told me as much , and i knew it , too .
so , take me , death !
you ’ ll be back at two o 'clock ?
yes , sweet rosalind .
so beware of my contempt , and keep your promise .
i ’ ll keep my promise just as if you really were rosalind .
so , goodbye .
well , time is the old judge that tries your kind of criminal .
goodbye .
you have absolutely abused our sex in this love talk of yours .
we should rip off your man ’ s clothing and show the world the woman who has represented her own kind so badly .
oh cousin , cousin , cousin , my sweet little cousin , i wish you knew how deep in love i am .
or it ’ s bottomless , at least : pour affection in one end , and it runs out the other .
cupid — that blind bastard son of venus , conceived from a thought and anger , born from insanity , that blind , naughty boy who makes everyone else go blind just because he can ’ t see himself — let cupid judge how deep my love runs .
i ’ m telling you , aliena , i can ’ t stand being apart from orlando .
i ’ m going to find some shade and sigh until he returns .
and i ’ m going to sleep .
which one of you killed the deer ?
yes , sir .
then sing it .
it doesn ’ t matter if it ’ s in tune so long as it ’ s loud enough .
what do you say now ?
isn ’ t it past two o 'clock ?
and i see a lot of orlando here .
look who ’ s coming .
no , i swear , i don ’ t even know what ’ s in it .
phoebe wrote it .
well , then , what should we do for fun instead ?
let ’ s go find that hussy , fortune , and and mock her till she starts distributing her gifts more equally .
oh , really ?
well , when nature makes a person beautiful , can ’ t fortune make her fall into a fire , thereby making her ugly after all ?
and even though nature has given us the wit to have this argument , hasn ’ t fortune sent this fool here to stop us ?
come on , you ’ re a fool , and driven to extreme measures by love .
the point is that she didn ’ t write this letter .
these are a man ’ s words , and his handwriting .
i ’ m telling you , it ’ s hers .
why , she challenges me like a muslim would challenge a christian .
no , a woman ’ s gentle brain could never have come up with such crude expressions and even harsher meanings .
do you want to hear what she says ?
if you want to read it , as i haven ’ t heard it yet , though i ’ ve heard too much of phoebe ’ s cruelty .
she ’ s phoebe-ing me .
listen to what the tyrant says .
you call that ranting ?
you call this sneering ?
why do you pity him ?
follow them straight to the cottage .
since you asked , i suppose it ’ s not bragging to say that we are .
orlando sends his regards to you both , and he sends this bloody handkerchief to the boy he calls “ his rosalind . ” is that you ?
it is .
it ’ s about who i am , and how , why , and where this handkerchief was stained .
please , tell us .
he discovered that the man was his older brother .
oh , i ’ ve heard him talk about that brother , and he described him as the most inhumane man alive .
he turned away twice and almost left him there .
are you his brother ?
was it you that he rescued ?
was it you that was always plotting to kill him ?
that was me , but it ’ s not me — i ’ m not ashamed to tell you what i once was , since i ’ m so happy to have since converted .
but what about the bloody handkerchief ?
i ’ ll get there .
after a brief time — as he is a strong , brave man —
many people faint when they see blood .
there ’ s more to it than that . — ganymede !
look , he ’ s recovering .
i want to go home .
we ’ ll take you there .
please , will you take his arm ?
buck up , boy !
you ’ re a man ?
you don ’ t have a man ’ s courage .
it ’ s true , i confess .
oh , sir , someone would think i was a good fake .
please tell your brother what a convincing show i put on .
whoo-hoo !
that was no show .
your cheeks are too flushed for me to believe that was a fake faint .
fake , i ’ m telling you .
well , then , be brave and pretend to be a man .
that ’ s what i ’ m doing .
but honestly , i should have been a woman .
come on , you keep getting paler .
i ’ ll do that , because i have to tell my brother how you forgave him , rosalind .
i ’ ll think of something .
but please , tell him how well i faked a faint .
will you come with us ?
we ’ ll get married at some point , audrey .
be patient .
really , the priest was good enough , no matter what that old guy said .
no , he was wicked and vile .
but audrey , there ’ s a boy in the forest who claims you ’ re his girl .
here comes the man himself .
it warms my heart to encounter such a country bumpkin .
how old are you , friend ?
twenty-five , sir .
a mature age .
is your name william ?
yes , it ’ s william , sir .
a good name .
were you born here in the forest ?
yes sir , thank god .
thank god ” — that ’ s a good answer .
are you rich ?
well , so-so .
so-so ” is good , very good , an excellent answer .
and then again , it ’ s not so good , but only so-so .
are you wise ?
yes sir , i ’ m fairly witty .
well , that ’ s a fine answer .
give me your hand .
are you educated ?
no , sir .
then learn this from me : if you have something , you have it .
everyone knows that when you pour a drink out of a cup and into a glass , the cup becomes empty .
why , the he that will marry this woman .
i ’ ll poison you , or beat you with a club , or stab you with a sword .
i ’ ll bandy you about and overwhelm you with my cleverness .
i will , in other words , kill you in three hundred and fifty ways .
therefore , tremble with fear and leave .
do what he says , william .
farewell , sir .
our master and mistress are looking for you .
let ’ s go .
hurry up , audrey , hurry . — i ’ m coming , i ’ m coming .
mistress , you have to go see your father .
did they make you the messenger ?
from a certain knight who swore on his honor that the pancakes he was eating were good , and that the mustard on top of them — he swore on his honor — was bad .
now , i ’ ll swear to the opposite — that the pancakes were rotten , and the mustard was fine — but even so , the knight wasn ’ t lying .
and how , out of your great heap of knowledge , will you manage to prove that ?
yes , please ; unleash your wisdom .
watch me : stroke your chins and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards ( if we had them ) , you are a knave .
and i swear by my wickedness ( if i had any ) that i am a knave .
is it really possible that you could like her right after meeting her ?
it will be to your advantage , because i ’ ll leave our father ’ s house and all his property to you , while i live and die a shepherd here in the forest .
you have my consent .
you can be married tomorrow if you want .
i ’ ll invite the duke and all of his followers .
go get aliena ready — because , look , here comes my rosalind .
and hello to you , fair sister .
oh , darling orlando , it ’ s so hard to see you wearing your heart in a sling .
actually , it ’ s my arm .
i thought your heart had been wounded by a lion ’ s claws .
they ’ re in the heat of passion ; they simply have to be together .
you couldn ’ t beat the two of them apart .
they ’ ll be married tomorrow , and i ’ ll invite the duke to the ceremony .
but , oh , it makes me bitter to look at happiness through another man ’ s eyes .
tomorrow i ’ ll be at the depths of my misery thinking about the happiness my brother has achieved , in having what he wished for .
well then , can ’ t i act as rosalind for you tomorrow ?
i can ’ t live by pretending anymore .
i won ’ t exhaust you anymore with idle chitchat .
you should know that i think you ’ re a smart man .
believe me , then , that i have special powers .
since i was three years old , i ’ ve been in contact with a powerful but virtuous magician — no black magic here .
if you love rosalind as much as you say you do , you will marry her when your brother marries aliena .
i know where she is and , if you don ’ t mind , i will set her before you tomorrow , whole and unharmed .
are you serious ?
i swear on my life , which i take pretty seriously , even if i am a magician .
look , here comes someone who loves me , along with someone who loves her .
i don ’ t care .
a faithful shepherd worships you .
silvius , tell this youth what it means to be in love .
it means being full of sighs and tears , like i am for phoebe .
and like i am for ganymede .
and like i am for rosalind .
and like i am for no woman .
it means being faithful and ready to serve , just like i am for phoebe .
and like i am for ganymede .
and like i am for rosalind .
and like i am for no woman .
and i for rosalind .
and i for no woman .
since you know all this is true , why do you blame me for loving you ?
and why do you blame me for loving you ?
and why do you blame me for loving you ?
who are you talking to ?
i ’ m saying it to the girl who isn ’ t here and doesn ’ t hear me .
all right , stop this .
you sound like a pack of wolves howling at the moon .
as long as i ’ m alive , i ’ ll be here .
me too .
me too .
tomorrow is the happy day , audrey .
we ’ ll be married tomorrow .
i hope it doesn ’ t make me unchaste that i really want to be a married woman .
here come two of duke senior ’ s pages .
good afternoon , good gentleman .
it really is good to see you .
come , sit , sit , and sing me a song .
sounds good to us .
sit between us .
should we just get down to it ?
yes , yes , and let ’ s sing in unison , like two gypsies riding on a single horse .
really , young men , though it wasn ’ t a very hard song to get right , the music was still all out of tune .
orlando , do you really believe that this boy can do everything he ’ s promised ?
yes , even if i had whole kingdoms to give along with her .
i will , even if i were king of all kingdoms .
yes , even if i die an hour later .
but if you decide not to marry me , you ’ ll marry this faithful shepherd instead ?
that ’ s the deal .
even if marrying her meant i died .
i ’ ve promised to make everything right .
phoebe , keep your promise to marry me , and to marry this shepherd if you choose to refuse me .
silvius , keep your promise to marry phoebe if she refuses me .
i ’ ll leave now , to set all these things right .
this shepherd boy reminds me quite vividly of my daughter .
my lord , when i first saw him i thought he was your daughter ’ s brother .
but , my lord , this boy was born in the forest and has been schooled not in the usual subjects but only in magic .
my lord , welcome this man .
this is the jester i have met so many times in the forest .
he swears he used to be a courtier .
if anyone doubts this , let him put me on trial .
i have bankrupted three tailors .
i have quarreled four times , and almost got in a fight .
and how was that one settled ?
well , we almost fought and then realized that we had reached the seventh cause .
what do you mean , the seventh cause ?
i like him very well .
tell me , who is this knight ?
a man old frederick , your father , loves .
if he has my father ’ s love , then that ’ s enough honor for me .
enough of this .
no more talk about my father ; you ’ ll be whipped for slander one of these days .
it ’ s a pity that fools aren ’ t allowed to speak wisely about the foolish things that wise men do .
honestly , you ’ re speaking the truth — ever since the fools were with his mouth full of news .
which he ’ ll shove down our throats the way pigeons feed their young .
then we ’ ll be stuffed with news .
well that ’ s good .
if we ’ re hello , monsieur le beau .
what ’ s the news ?
fair princess , you ’ ve missed some good sport .
sport ?
of what
god bless you , sir .
this poor virgin isn ’ t much to look at , sir , but she ’ s mine .
really , he ’ s very witty , and full of wise sayings .
but back to that argument you mentioned .
what ’ s the “ seventh cause ” ?
i didn ’ t like the way a particular courtier had cut his beard .
he sent me word that , whether i liked it or not , he liked it fine .
they call this “ the argumentative countercheck . ” and so on through “ the circumstantial lie ” and “ the direct lie . ” and how many times did you say his beard wasn ’ t cut well ?
he ’ s as smart as they come , but just a jester .
he uses his clownishness to disguise his deadly wit .
there is laughter in heaven when earthly affairs are put right and people unite .
good duke , come receive your daughter .
hymen brought her from heaven yes , brought her here .
if my eyes don ’ t deceive me , you are my daughter .
if my eyes don ’ t deceive me , you are my rosalind .
if my eyes aren ’ t deceiving me , goodbye , love .
quiet !
my niece , you are welcome here as if you were my own daughter .
let me have your attention for a moment .
i ’ m sir rowland ’ s middle son , and i bring you news .
when duke frederick heard that great , worthy men were coming to this forest every day , he raised a large army to invade this land and fight his brother .
i swear on my life that i ’ m speaking the truth .
do you mean to say that the duke has abandoned the glamorous court to live as a monk ?
yes , he has .
i will go find him .
there is much to be learned from these converts .
stay , jaques , stay here for a bit .
no , this fun is not for me .
i ’ ll wait for you in your cave , where you can tell me what you need from me .
let ’ s proceed .
we ’ ll begin the ceremony the way we hope it will end — with delight .
if it ’ s true that you don ’ t need
what color , madam ?
i don ’ t understand — how should i answer that ?
however your wit and luck allow .
tell us about this wrestling .
well , we ’ ve missed the beginning ; it ’ s dead and buried .
there comes an old man with his three sons — it sounds like the beginning of an old folktale .
three proper young men , all good looking and with great presence —
charles did the same to the second brother , and the third .
they ’ re lying over there , and the poor old man , their father , weeps so piteously over them that the whole audience has joined him in grieving .
oh , dear !
but tell me , monsieur — what sport are the ladies missing ?
why , the one i just told you about .
me too , i swear .
doesn ’ t anyone else want to see this , and hear breath wheezing out from broken ribs ?
shall we go watch this wrestling , cousin ?
yes , i see them coming .
let ’ s stay and watch .
come on .
since the youth won ’ t be reasoned with , he ’ ll have to suffer for his stubbornness .
is that the man ?
that ’ s him , madam .
alas , he is too young .
yet he seems capable .
what ’ s up , daughter and niece ?
have you snuck over here to watch the wrestling ?
yes , my lord , if you give us permission .
you won ’ t enjoy it much , i can tell you , the odds are so against this young man .
because he ’ s so young , i ’ ve tried to discourage him , but he won ’ t listen .
call him over here , good monsieur le beau .
i remember , adam , that ’ s here comes my master , your brother .
go hide , adam , and you ’ ll hear how he abuses me .
mister challenger , the princess wants to speak to you .
i ’ ll wait on them with all respect and duty .
young man , have you challenged charles the wrestler ?
no , lovely princess .
he is the general challenger .
i have only come in — like the others have — to try to fight him with the strength of my youth .
young gentleman , you are too bold for your age .
you have seen the cruel proof of this man ’ s strength .
if you took a good look at yourself , or if you thought about this more carefully , your fear would teach you to act more cautiously .
we beg you , for your own sake , to respect your safety and give up .
please , young sir .
if i ’ m killed , it will only be the death of a man who was willing to be dead .
i won ’ t wrong any of my friends , because i don ’ t have any to mourn for me , and i won ’ t have wronged the world , because i don ’ t have anything in the world .
in this world , i ’ m only taking up space .
i wish i could give you the little strength that i have .
mine too , to join hers .
good luck .
i hope to god i ’ m wrong about your chances .
i hope you get what you desire !
you get only one round .
no , i ’ m sure your grace won ’ t be able to persuade him to try a second round , even though you couldn ’ t dissuade him from trying the first .
you should mock me i wish i were invisible , so i could grab that strong fellow by the leg .
oh , what an excellent young man !
if i could shoot lightning bolts from my eyes , i can tell you who ’ d be on the ground .
no more , no more .
how are you doing , charles ?
he can ’ t speak , my lord .
carry him away .
what is your name , young man ?
orlando , my lord , the youngest son of sir rowland de boys .
i wish you were someone else ’ s son .
the whole world thought your father was an honorable man , but he was always my enemy .
i wish you had told me you had a different father .
if i were my father , cousin , would i do this ?
i ’ m proud to be sir rowland ’ s son — his youngest son — and i would never change that , not even to be frederick ’ s adopted heir .
my father loved sir rowland as much as he loved his own soul , and the rest of the world shared my father ’ s opinion .
if i had known this young man was his son , i would have tried harder to convince him not to fight .
gentle cousin , let ’ s go thank him and encourage him .
yes .
good luck , fair gentleman .
he ’ s calling us back .
my will you come on , cousin ?
i ’ m coming .
farewell .
what is this passion that ties up my tongue ?
i can ’ t speak to her , even though she asked me to .
either charles or some prettier thing has mastered you .
good sir , as a friend , i advise you to leave this place .
although you deserve praise , applause , and love , right now the duke misconstrues everything you ’ ve done .
the duke is temperamental .
goodbye , sir .
later , in a better world than this , i ’ d love to get to know you .
i ’ m indebted to you .
goodbye .
out of the frying pan and into the fire — from a tyrant duke to a tyrant brother !
but , oh , heavenly rosalind !
what ’ s going on , rosalind ?
i don ’ t even have one to throw at a dog .
no , your words are too precious to be wasted on dogs .
throw some of your words at me .
then there would be two cousins lying sick in bed : one hurt by reasons and the other gone crazy without any .
is all of this about your father ?
no , some of it is about my child ’ s father .
if we walk on the well-worn paths , they won ’ t get caught in our petticoats .
cough them up .
i ’ d try it , if i could cry “ hem ” and have him .
come on , take control of your feelings .
but they ’ re siding with a better wrestler than myself .
oh , that ’ s a good wish !
you ’ ll fight with him eventually , and the duke , my father , loved his father very much .
does that necessarily mean you should love his son ?
by that kind of logic , i should hate orlando , since my father hates his father .
but i don ’ t hate orlando .
no , please don ’ t hate him — for my sake .
why shouldn ’ t i ?
doesn ’ t he deserve it ?
let me love him because he deserves it , and you can love him because i do .
look , here comes the duke .
he looks angry .
madam , hurry as fast as you can get out of my court .
me , uncle ?
you , niece .
in ten days time , if you ’ re found within twenty miles of the court , you ’ ll die for it .
please , your grace , tell me what crime i have committed .
all traitors protest like this .
if they could purge their guilt simply by saying that they were innocent , they ’ d all be as innocent as god himself .
i don ’ t trust you .
you are your father ’ s daughter .
that ’ s enough .
i was his daughter when your highness took my father ’ s dukedom .
i was his daughter when you banished him .
my father wasn ’ t a traitor .
so , please , my lord , don ’ t assume that i ’ m treacherous just because i ’ m poor , with no titles to my name .
dear master , listen to me .
yes , celia , we kept her here for your sake .
i was too young at the time to appreciate her value , but now i know her .
if she ’ s a traitor , why then , so am i.
you ’ re a fool .
you will seem even brighter and more virtuous when she ’ s out of the picture .
so be quiet .
the sentence i ’ ve passed down on her is firm and unshakeable .
she is banished .
then lay that sentence on me too , my lord .
i cannot live without her .
you are a fool . — you , niece , prepare to leave .
on my honor and by my word , if you outstay the ten days , you will die .
oh , my poor rosalind , where will you go ?
do you want to exchange fathers ?
i ’ ll give you mine .
i insist , don ’ t be more distressed than i am .
i have more reason to be distressed .
hey , you !
what are you nothing .
i ’ ve never been taught how to make anything .
well , then , what are you messing up ?
i ’ m helping indeed , sir , find something better to do and get lost for a while .
should i tend your pigs and eat husks with them ?
when did i do you know where you are , sir ?
yes , sir , very well — i ’ m here in your orchard .
do you know whom you ’ re talking to ?
yes , better than you know me .
i know you ’ re my oldest brother , and deserve more respect .
i have as much of our father in me as you do , though i admit you ’ re closer to him and matter more because you ’ re older .
no you haven ’ t , cousin .
please , be cheerful .
don ’ t you realize the duke has also banished me , his daughter ?
no , he hasn ’ t .
oh , he hasn ’ t ?
well , then , you don ’ t have the affection that would teach you that you and i are one .
will we be separated ?
should we part , sweet girl ?
i swear by the heavens , which have grown pale in sympathy with us , i ’ m going with you , whatever you say .
but where will we go ?
to the forest of arden , to find your father .
but what danger we ’ ll put ourselves in , two young , innocent women traveling so far !
fresh beauty attracts thugs and thieves even more than money .
i ’ ll put on some poor and ragged clothes and smudge my face with dirt .
wouldn ’ t it be better — since i ’ m unusually tall for a woman — to dress myself like a man ?
what should i call you when you ’ re a man ?
i ’ ll take no lesser name than that of something that refers to my current state .
instead of celia , call me aliena .
wouldn ’ t he be a comfort to us in our travels ?
let ’ s go gather our jewels and money .
we ’ ll figure out the best time and safest route to avoid being found out by my father ’ s guards , whom he ’ ll send out as soon as he discovers i ’ ve gone .
now , we go contentedly to freedom — not banishment .
now , my companions and brothers in exile , hasn ’ t experience made this simple life sweeter than a life of glittery pomp and circumstance ?
aren ’ t these woods less perilous than the court , with all its jealousies and intrigues ?
you ’ re lucky , my lord , to be able to see the peace and sweetness even in what bad luck has brought you .
come , shall we hunt some deer for dinner ?
it bothers me , though , that these poor spotted innocents , who , after all , are this deserted city ’ s native citizens , should be gouged with arrows .
indeed , my lord , the gloomy jaques grieves over these deaths .
big , round tears ran piteously down the animal ’ s innocent nose .
and did you leave him like this ?
we did , my lord , weeping and carrying on about the sobbing deer .
take me to him .
i love to argue with him when he ’ s having one of these fits , because then he always has a lot to say .
i ’ ll bring you to him right away .
can it be possible that no one saw them leave ?
it cannot be .
some villains in my court must have known about this and let it happen .
i can ’ t find anyone who saw her leave .
her ladies-in-waiting saw her go to bed , and early this morning the bed was empty .
my lord , that dirty clown whom you laughed at so often is also missing .
send a message to his brother .
bring that swinger orlando here .
if he ’ s not around , bring his brother oliver to me .
i ’ ll make oliver find him .
do this immediately , and don ’ t stop searching and interrogating until you ’ ve brought home these foolish runaways .
who ’ s there ?
what are you doing here ?
why are you so strong and good ?
why do people love you ?
and why are you noble , strong , and brave ?
why would you be so foolish as to beat the moody duke ’ s favorite champion ?
your praise has beaten you home .
don ’ t you know , master , that some men ’ s best qualities do them in ?
oh , what a world this is , when even what is beautiful in a man poisons him !
why , what ’ s the matter ?
in this house lives a man who despises all that is good in you .
and if he fails at that , he will find other ways to kill you .
i overheard him and his plans .
this is no place for you ; this home is now a slaughterhouse .
hate it , fear it , do not come inside .
then where would you have me go , adam ?
it doesn ’ t matter where , so long as it ’ s not here .
what , would you have me beg for my food ?
this is all that ’ s left for me to do , but i won ’ t do it .
i ’ d rather give myself up to the hatred of a violent brother who refuses to recognize that we are brothers .
but don ’ t do that .
let me be your servant .
i know i may be old , but i ’ m strong and healthy , because in my youth i never drank nor lived recklessly .
therefore , my old age is like a blustery winter : cold , but kindly .
let me go with you .
i ’ ll do everything a younger man could do for you .
oh , good old man , you ’ re a great example of that old work ethic , where people worked because it was their duty , not just for the money .
come along , though .
we ’ ll go together , and before we ’ ve spent all the savings of your youth , we ’ ll find a way to make a living .
go on , master , and i will follow you — with truth and loyalty to my last breath .
from the time i was seventeen , over sixty years ago , i have lived in this house , but now i will live here no more .
many men seek their fortune at seventeen ; at eighty , it ’ s a bit late .
but fortune could not reward me better than to let me die well , without owing my master anything .
oh lord , my spirits are tired !
i wouldn ’ t care about my spirits , if my legs weren ’ t tired .
i can ’ t go any further .
i ’ d rather bear with you than well , this is the forest of arden .
yes , now i ’ m in arden , and that makes me the bigger fool .
yes , be content , good touchstone .
look who ’ s coming : a young man and an old man , having a serious talk .
what , you dare put your hands on me , villain ?
i ’ m no villain .
if you weren ’ t my brother , i ’ d leave this hand of mine on your neck until i ’ d pulled out your tongue for talking like this .
you ’ ve only insulted yourself .
gentlemen , calm down .
for the sake of your father ’ s memory , make peace .
let me go , i say .
i won ’ t until i ’ m ready .
you will listen to me .
my father instructed you in his will to give me a good education .
but you ’ ve raised me as a peasant , hiding from me what i needed to become a gentleman .
my father ’ s spirit is growing in me , and i won ’ t take this any longer .
and what are you going to do after you ’ ve spent your money ?
well , sir , go inside .
i ’ m not going to be bothered by you for long .
you ’ ll get some of what you want .
now please leave me alone .
what you ’ re doing is the way to make her scorn you continually .
oh , corin , i wish you could understand how much i love her !
i ’ m sure i can guess .
no corin , since you ’ re old , you cannot guess — even if you were as dedicated a lover in your youth as there ever was , sighing and mooning all night long .
if your love was anything like mine — and i ’ m sure that no man has loved as i love now — exactly how many ridiculous actions did your fantasizing lead you to ?
oh , a thousand of them , all of which i ’ ve forgotten .
oh , then you never loved as wholeheartedly as me .
if you can ’ t remember the stupidest little thing love made you do , you haven ’ t loved .
or if you haven ’ t sat as i do now , boring your listener with all your lover ’ s virtues , then you haven ’ t loved .
or if you haven ’ t broken away from human company , as my feelings now lead me to do , you haven ’ t loved .
o phoebe , phoebe , phoebe !
oh , poor shepherd !
me too .
i remember when i was in love , i broke my sword on a stone , and told him to take that for coming at night to see jane smile .
i remember kissing her washing stick and the cow ’ s udders that her pretty , chapped hands had milked .
i remember wooing a pea plant in her name , and then taking two pea pods and begging her to wear them “ for my sake . ” those of us who are really in love will do the strangest things .
but everything that lives is mortal , including the foolishness of love .
you speak more wisely than you know .
nah , i ’ ll never be aware of my own wit , until i break my shins on it .
by god !
and like mine , but i ’ m getting a little tired of it .
please , one of you go ask that man over there if we can buy some food off him .
shut up , fool .
he ’ s not your relative .
who ’ s calling ?
your superiors .
please sir , if love or money can buy anything in this empty place , tell us where we can rest and feed ourselves .
dear sir , i pity the lady and wish — more for her sake than my own — that i was more able to help her .
but i ’ m a hired hand : i don ’ t profit from the flocks i tend .
besides , his cottage , his flocks , and his grazing rights are on sale now , and since he ’ s not there , there ’ s nothing to eat at our house .
who wants to buy the flock and the pasture ?
that young man who was just here .
please , if you can do it without taking advantage of the young man , buy the cottage , pasture , and flock for us , and we ’ ll pay you for it .
and we will raise your wages .
the thing is definitely going to be sold .
come with me .
if you like what you see of the land , the profit that ’ s possible , and this rustic life , i ’ ll be your faithful servant , and buy the place with your gold right away .
more , more , please , more .
it ’ s only going to make you sad , monsieur jaques .
i ’ m glad about that .
more , please , more .
i can suck sadness out of a song the way a weasel sucks eggs .
more , please , more .
my voice is ragged .
i know i won ’ t please you .
come on , another stanza — is that what you call ' em , “ stanzas ” ?
nah , i don ’ t care what their
well then , if i ’ ve ever thanked a man , i ’ ll thank you now .
but two men complimenting each other is like two baboons getting together .
the duke will drink under this tree . — he ’ s been looking for you all day , you know .
and i ’ ve been avoiding him all day .
he ’ s too argumentative for me .
i think of as many things as he does , but i just thank heaven and don ’ t show off about it .
come , warble for me .
i wrote a verse to this tune , though it ’ s not very imaginative .
dear master , i can ’ t go any farther .
oh , i ’ m dying of hunger .
i ’ ll lie down here and measure out my grave .
farewell , kind master .
hey , what ’ s this , adam ?
no braver than this ?
live a little , be comforted a little , cheer up a little .
if i can find any animal in this wild forest , i ’ ll either be food for it or bring it as food for you .
you ’ re not as close to death as you think you are .
i ’ ll be back soon , and if i haven ’ t brought you anything to eat , i will give you permission to die .
but if you die before i return , you ’ ll have made a mockery of my efforts .
there we go !
you look happier already , and i ’ ll be back quickly .
but you ’ re lying out in the cold .
cheer up , good adam .
i think he must have turned into an animal , because i can ’ t find him anywhere looking like a man .
my lord , he just left here .
he was happy here , listening to a song .
if that man , who ’ s made up of conflicts , becomes musical , then there must be something wrong with the universe .
go find him .
tell him i want to speak with him .
he saved me the trouble : here he comes .
well , what ’ s going on , mister ?
what kind of life do you lead that your poor friends must beg for your company ?
what , you look amused .
then he pulled a watch from his bag and , looking at it solemnly , said , “ it ’ s ten o 'clock .
this way , we can see how the world moves .
only an hour ago it was nine , and in another hour it will be eleven .
oh , noble fool !
a worthy fool !
motley is the only thing to wear .
who is this fool ?
a worthy fool !
god bless my old master .
he would never have spoken to me like this .
is that how it ’ s going to be ?
are you starting to challenge me ?
i ’ ll cure you of your insolence , and i ’ m not going to give you a thousand crowns , either ! — hey , dennis !
did you call for me , your worship ?
wasn ’ t charles , the duke ’ s wrestler , here to speak with me ?
yes , sir , he ’ s here at the door right now and asks to see you .
call him in .
i have a good plan .
like the wind , i must have the freedom to blast anyone i please , as fools do .
and whoever is most irritated by my foolishness has to laugh the hardest .
why , sir , must he ?
well , it ’ s as plain as the beaten path to a parish church .
dress me up in motley .
let me speak my mind , and i ’ ll rid the world of its sickness — if it will only tolerate my medicine .
to hell with you !
i know what you ’ d do .
what would i do besides good ?
who can say i mean just her when all her neighbors are exactly like her ?
and when some lowlife protests that stop , and eat no more .
but i haven ’ t eaten anything yet .
and you won ’ t until the needy eat .
what kind of fighting cock is this ?
are you acting so boldly from hardship or because you despise good manners ?
you were right the first time .
but stop , i say .
if you won ’ t listen to reason , i ’ ll have to die .
what would you like ?
gentlemanly manners have more sway around here than force does .
i ’ m dying for food , so let me have some .
sit down and eat , and welcome to our table .
do you really speak like such a gentleman ?
i beg your pardon .
i thought everything out here was wild , which is why i acted so stern and commanding .
we have in fact seen better days and been summoned to church by the ringing of the holy bell and sat at good men ’ s feasts and cried tears of pity — therefore , sit down and take whatever will satisfy your needs .
then please , put off your eating for a little while i , like a mother doe , find my fawn and bring it food .
there is a poor old man who , purely out of love , has limped after me for miles .
thank you , and god bless you for your hospitality .
you see , we ’ re not alone in our unhappiness .
the whole world is a stage , and all the men and women merely actors .
they have their exits and their entrances , and in his lifetime a man will play many parts , his life separated into seven acts .
in the first act he is an infant , whimpering and puking in his nurse ’ s arms .
then he ’ s the whining schoolboy , with a book bag and a bright , young face , creeping like a snail unwillingly to school .
he ’ s full of wise sayings and up-to-the-minute anecdotes : that ’ s the way he plays his part .
welcome .
set the honorable old man down and let him eat .
i thank you very much on his behalf .
welcome .
eat .
i won ’ t trouble you yet with questions about your situation . — some music , please , and , good friend , sing .
time ’ s not the one in debt .
your logic is so foolish .
take it to your master and bring him home immediately .
every person i meet greets me like an old friend , and every one of them knows my name .
some of them give me money , some invite me places , some thank me for the kind things i ’ ve done for them , some try to sell me things .
just now a tailor showed me fabrics he bought especially for me and then started to take my measurements .
these are tricks of the imagination , and this place is filled with magicians .
here ’ s the money you wanted , master .
who ’ s this adam you speak of ?
i don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about .
no ?
you mean an officer ?
are any ships leaving tonight ?
can we go ?
why , sir , i told you an hour ago that the good ship this fellow ’ s gone mad , and so have i. we ’ re in some kind of dream world .
please , somebody , get us out of here !
good to see you , master antipholus .
i see you ’ ve met with the jeweler .
is that chain you ’ re wearing the one you promised to give to me ?
get away from me , satan !
don ’ t try to tempt me !
master , is this satan ’ s mistress ?
she ’ s the devil .
no , she ’ s worse : she ’ s the devil ’ s mother , and she comes to us disguised as an easy wench .
but fire also gives off light , and fire will burn you .
you and your servant are very funny , sir .
will you come with me ?
can we finish our lunch ?
master , if you eat with her , bring really long silverware .
why , dromio ?
some now listen , either give me my ring or give me the necklace .
i hope you ’ re not trying to cheat me .
come , dromio , let ’ s go .
mistress , you know about that .
antipholus has gone insane , no question about it .
he has a ring of mine , worth forty ducats , and he promised to give me a necklace in exchange for it .
now he won ’ t give me either .
the reason i think he ’ s insane , besides the way he just acted , is that he told a senseless story over lunch about being locked out of his own house .
his wife probably did it on purpose because she knows what kind of fits he ’ s having .
i must go to his house and tell his wife that he came bursting into my place like a lunatic and stole my ring .
it ’ s my best option : i can ’ t afford to lose forty ducats .
i ’ ve spent five years in the remotest parts of greece and roaming all over asia .
however , i ’ ll do what i can for you .
i will allow you one day to look for help in ephesus .
i will .
don ’ t worry , man , i won ’ t try to escape .
i tell you , this will make her angry when she hears about it .
here ’ s my servant .
i think he ’ s got the money .
hello there , sir !
do you have what i told you to get ?
yes .
but where ’ s the money ?
why , sir , i spent it on this rope .
i can get you five hundred ropes for that price .
why did i just send you home ?
and here i am , with that piece .
and i ’ ll use that piece of rope to welcome you with .
good sir , calm down .
hold your tongue .
no , you should tell him to hold his hands !
i wish i were senseless , sir , so that i wouldn ’ t feel your punches !
the only thing you can sense are punches — just like an ass .
i am an ass , indeed : you can tell by my long ears .
i figure that once he ’ s crippled me , i ’ ll beg by showing off my beatings .
that ’ s enough .
my wife ’ s coming .
mistress , think about your end — beware of your death !
ephesus now what do you think ?
your husband ’ s mad , isn ’ t he ?
he ’ s trembling in his fit !
i demand this in the name of all the saints in heaven .
shut up , you doddering old wizard !
i ’ m not possessed !
oh , i wish you weren ’ t , you poor , frightened soul .
listen , hussy — is this man one of your customers ?
did this fool with the yellow face feast and celebrate in my house today while the guilty doors shut in my face and locked me out of my own house ?
ate at home ?
you there , rogue , what do you have to say about that ?
i swear , sir , you did not eat at home .
my doors were locked and i was shut out , right ?
by god , your doors were locked and you were shut out .
and she screamed at me , right ?
no lie — she screamed at you .
and her cook yelled , mocked , and teased me , right ?
and i departed in a rage , right ?
you truly did .
good idea .
i gave it to dromio , who rushed in for it .
you gave money to me ?
didn ’ t you go to her for a purse full of ducats ?
he did , and i gave it to him .
and i saw her do it .
i was sent for a rope !
mistress , both the man and his master are possessed .
i can tell by how pale and deathlike they look .
we must tie them up and leave them in some dark room .
my sweet husband , i did not lock you out .
and my sweet master , i received no gold .
but i agree , sir , that we were locked out .
keep him away from me !
we need more help !
the devil in him is strong !
jailer , i ’ m your prisoner .
are you going to let them break me out of jail ?
gentlemen , let go of him .
he ’ s my prisoner and you can ’ t have him .
tie up the servant , for he is mad as well .
he ’ s my prisoner .
if i let him go , i ’ ll have to pay his bail fees myself .
i ’ ll pay you .
take me to the man my husband is in debt to .
what a horrible day !
what a horrible slut !
master , i ’ m all tied up for you .
the poor souls — how strangely they talk !
angelo , the jeweler .
do you know him ?
i know him .
two hundred ducats .
for what ?
for a necklace your husband had him make .
he said he was going to buy me a necklace , but i never saw it .
i need to hear the truth about all this .
god have mercy on us !
and they ’ ve got their swords unsheathed !
let ’ s call for help and get them tied up again !
let ’ s get out of here !
they ’ ll kill us !
it looks like these witches are scared of swords .
the one who claims to be your wife just ran away from you .
i wish we were safely on board our ship already .
look , let ’ s stay here tonight .
nobody will hurt us .
you see how kind everyone is to us , how they just hand us gold .
i think this country is so kind that if it weren ’ t for
that mountain of insanity that wants to marry me , i could find it in my heart to stay here and become a witch myself .
i wouldn ’ t stay here tonight for the entire town .
go and get our stuff onto the ship .
what ’ s this man ’ s reputation like here in the city ?
i ’ d trust him with everything i own .
you ’ re right .
and that necklace around his neck is the very one he swore he didn ’ t have !
good sir , stay close to me .
so , tell people that you ’ re from epidamnum – otherwise all your goods will be confiscated .
here ’ s the money you asked me to hold .
dromio , bring this money to the centaur inn , where we ’ re lodging , and wait there until i come .
it ’ ll be lunchtime within an hour .
until then , i ’ ll walk around town , peruse the markets , and gaze upon the buildings , and then i ’ ll return and sleep at the inn .
get going now .
many men would take you literally and take off with all this money .
often , when i ’ m dulled by worry and melancholy , he lightens my mood with his merry pranks .
listen , will you walk with me around the town and then dine with me at the inn ?
but if
i got it from you — i never said i didn ’ t .
yes , you did , sir .
who heard me do that ?
my own ears heard it , and you know it .
to hell with you !
it ’ s a shame that you walk the streets with all the honest men .
you ’ re a villain to say this about me .
i ’ ll prove that i ’ m an honest man and a man of honor if you dare defend yourself .
i do dare , and i say that you are the villain .
run , master , run .
for god ’ s sake , find a house to duck into .
this looks like an abbey .
go in , or we ’ re done for .
be quiet , people !
why have you come here in such a mob ?
to get my poor , mad husband out from inside there .
let us in so we can tie him up tight and bring him home to recover .
how long has he been possessed like this ?
this week he was sad , moody , and depressed and very different from his usual self .
but it wasn ’ t until this afternoon that he broke out into violence .
that ’ s a sin young men often commit because they allow their eyes to wander .
which of these bad things happened to him ?
you should have reprimanded him for that .
i did .
fine , but you weren ’ t harsh enough .
you scolded him in private ?
and in public too .
fine , but not enough .
he couldn ’ t eat without me talking about it .
all i ever did was tell him how hurtful and bad it was .
and that ’ s why he went crazy .
a jealous woman ’ s poisonous ranting is worse than the bite of a rabid dog .
you seasoned his food with screams .
fever , as we know , is a kind of madness .
ruining his meals , his enjoyment , and his sleep would drive any man or beast mad .
what i ’ m saying is , your jealousy has pushed your husband away from his sanity .
gentlemen , go in there and grab him .
then have your servants bring him out .
healing is part and parcel of my religious vows ; it is a charitable duty my order performs .
therefore , depart , and leave him here with me .
be quiet and depart .
you ’ re not going to take him .
go lodge a complaint about this with the duke .
come with me .
i ’ ll fall at his feet and lie there until my pleading and crying convinces the duke to come here and force my husband to leave this abbey .
it ’ s almost five o 'clock .
to see an elderly , unlucky merchant from syracuse publicly beheaded for breaking the law and coming here to ephesus .
here they come .
we will watch the execution .
kneel down to the duke before he passes by the abbey .
one more time , we proclaim this publicly : if anyone will pay this man ’ s bail , he will not be put to death .
duke , the abbess has wronged me and i seek justice .
she ’ s a virtuous and holy lady .
she can ’ t possibly have done you any wrong .
so please , most gracious duke , order her to bring him out so we can get him some help .
and when you married him and made him the master of your bed , i gave you my word that i would do everything i possibly could for him .
shut up , fool !
your master and his servant are here .
mistress , i swear on my life that it ’ s true .
it was just moments ago .
he ’ s crying out for you and swears he ’ ll burn your face and disfigure you if he can get ahold of you .
oh , my , it ’ s my husband .
look , he can become invisible .
just now we put him in the abbey over here , and now he ’ s over there .
in exchange for the blood i shed for you then , i ask you for justice now .
the things she has shamelessly hurled on me are beyond imagination .
today , great duke , she locked me out of my house and feasted there with whores .
that ’ s terrible !
no , my good lord .
i ate with him and my sister .
damn my soul if these accusations are true !
if she ’ s lying , i pray that i never sleep again at night or wake up during the day .
oh , lying woman !
my lord , i know what i ’ m saying .
he left to fetch a necklace and he promised to bring it to the porcupine , where i was dining with balthasar .
he hadn ’ t arrived by the time we finished eating , so i went out looking for him .
i met him in the street — he was there with that man .
on the way , we came across my wife , her sister , and their gang of vile associates .
one of them was a man named pinch : a hungry , narrow-faced villain ; a skeleton ; a fraud ; a raggedy magician and fortune-teller ; a needy , hollow-eyed , emaciated wretch ; a walking corpse .
he pretended to be some kind of sorcerer , and he gazed in my eyes and took my pulse .
they left me and my servant there , tied together .
he did , my lord .
i never saw the necklace , so help me heaven !
why , what a complicated case this is !
it pleases you , i ’ ll meet you in the marketplace at five and will keep you company until bedtime .
right now , my pressing business calls me away .
farewell till then .
i will go lose myself , wandering up and down throughout the city .
sir , i leave you to your own contentment .
he leaves me to my own contentment , but that ’ s the one thing i cannot find .
out in the world , i ’ m like a drop of water , trying to find a drop that matches in the whole wide ocean .
in order to find a mother and a brother , i too have lost myself , unhappily .
how is it that you ’ ve come back so soon ?
back so soon ?
too late is more like it .
the chicken is burning , the pig is overcooked , the clock has already struck twelve , and my mistress has clocked me one on the cheek .
ate at home , but the jeweler says he didn ’ t .
sir , he ate with this woman at the porcupine .
he did , and he snatched my ring right off my finger .
that ’ s true , my lord : i did get this ring from her .
did you see him enter this abbey ?
as clearly as i see you , my lord .
i think you ’ re all either bewildered or stark raving mad .
mighty duke , please allow me to say something .
i think i see a friend who will pay my bail and save my life .
i was bound to him an hour ago , sir , but thankfully he chewed through our ropes .
now i ’ m dromio and no longer attached to him .
i ’ m sure you both remember me .
you ’ re not one of pinch ’ s patients , are you , sir ?
why are you looking at me so strangely ?
you know me well .
i never saw you before in my life .
oh , grief has transformed me since the last time you saw me .
but tell me this : don ’ t you know my voice ?
no .
don ’ t you , dromio ?
no sir , trust me , i do not .
you don ’ t know my voice ?
have you mangled my tongue so badly in these seven short years that my only son can no longer recognize my weak , sorrow-ravaged voice ?
all these aging faculties tell me — and i cannot be wrong — that you are my son , antipholus .
i never saw my father in my life .
you know that we parted only seven years ago , in syracuse .
your old age and the prospect of death are making you imagine things .
mighty duke , look here and see a man who ’ s been treated most terribly !
either my eyes deceive me , or i see two husbands .
i , sir , am dromio .
command this man to leave .
i , sir , am dromio .
pray , let me stay .
oh , my old master ! — who tied him up ?
tell us , old egeon : are you the man who once had a wife named emilia , who gave birth to two fair sons ?
oh , if you are the same egeon , speak now , and speak to that same emilia !
these two antipholuses , who look so alike — and these two dromios , who seem to have the same face — and her story of being shipwrecked — why , these two are the parents of these children and have been reunited by accident .
if i ’ m not dreaming , you are emilia .
if it ’ s really you , tell me what happened to our son , who floated away with you on that deadly raft .
antipholus , aren ’ t you originally from corinth ?
wait , don ’ t stand next to each other .
i can ’ t tell who ’ s who .
i came from corinth , your highness .
and i came with him .
your renowned uncle , duke menaphon , the famous soldier , brought me here .
which of you two ate lunch with me today ?
i did , kind lady .
and you ’ re my husband , right ?
that ’ s the necklace i gave you , sir .
i think it is , sir .
i don ’ t deny it .
and you , sir , had me arrested over that necklace .
i think i did , sir .
i don ’ t deny it .
i sent dromio to you with money for bail , but i don ’ t think he brought it to you .
no , he didn ’ t get any by me .
i got this purse full of money from you , and my dromio brought it to me .
i want to use this money to set my father free .
that ’ s not necessary .
i ’ m going to let him live .
sir , i must get that diamond ring back from you .
there , take it , and thanks for taking such good care of me .
renowned duke , please join us in the abbey , where we will discuss at length all that has happened to us .
after such a long period of grief , we will have such a celebration !
with all my heart , i ’ ll join you .
dromio , what stuff of mine did you put on a ship ?
the stuff you had at the centaur , sir .
i ’ m your master , dromio .
you have a fat friend at your master ’ s house : she took care of me in the kitchen today , thinking i was you .
i guess now she ’ s going to be my sister-in-law and not my wife .
i think you ’ re my mirror , not my brother .
do you want to go in and join the party ?
after you , sir .
you ’ re older than me .
that ’ s a good point .
how can we tell which of us is the oldest ?
we ’ ll draw straws .
meanwhile , after you .
we came into the world as brother and brother , so now let ’ s enter hand in hand — not one before the other .
hold on a second .
answer me this , please : where ’ s the money i gave you ?
oh , the sixpence you gave me last wednesday to buy leather goods for my mistress ?
the saddle maker has it , sir — i didn ’ t keep it .
i ’ m not in a joking mood .
tell me right now and stop fooling : where ’ s the money ?
we ’ re strangers here .
please , sir ; crack jokes over lunch .
i should think that your appetite would act like a clock ( as mine does ) and bring you home on its own , without the need for a messenger .
that ’ s enough , dromio , please .
this isn ’ t a good moment for jokes — save them till a happier time .
where ’ s the gold i gave you ?
gave me , sir ?
you didn ’ t give me any gold .
tell me what you ’ ve done with the money i entrusted to you .
the only thing that i ’ ve been entrusted with was getting you from the market and bringing you to your house , the phoenix , for lunch .
my mistress and her sister are waiting for you .
tell me where you ’ ve stowed away my money , or i swear i ’ ll break that comical head of yours for goofing when i ’ m not in the mood .
where are the thousand
your mistress ’ s marks ?
what mistress do you have ?
what , are you going to mock me to my face when i told you not to ?
there , take that , you scoundrel !
what are you doing ?
stop , for god ’ s sake !
well , if you don ’ t , then i ’ m out of here .
i swear , somehow the fool has been cheated out of all my money .
they say that this town is full of deception — illusionists that can fool the eye , dark sorcerers who can bewitch your mind , soul-killing witches who can disfigure your body , disguised swindlers , fast-talking fakers , and all kinds of other unchecked sins .
neither my husband nor the slave has returned , even though i sent the slave off running .
surely , luciana , it ’ s already two o 'clock .
maybe some merchant at the marketplace invited him home for lunch .
sister , let ’ s eat and stop worrying .
a man is master of his own freedom : time is his only master , and when the right moment comes along , he ’ ll come or go as he pleases .
if this is so , be patient , sister .
why should men be more free than women ?
because their business lies outside the home .
why , too much freedom leads to woe .
therefore , you should obey their wishes .
it ’ s this servantlike mentality that ’ s keeping you unmarried .
no , that ’ s not it — it ’ s because of what happens in the marriage bed .
but if you were married , you ’ d wield some influence .
before i learn how to love , i ’ ll learn how to follow orders .
what if your husband strays elsewhere ?
i ’ d endure it until he came home again .
now that ’ s patience !
no wonder she ’ s waiting to get married .
when we ’ re faced with a wretched person , bruised and crying with hardship , we try to get them to shush up .
but if you live to see yourself similarly denied your rights , this foolish patience will abandon you .
well , i ’ ll get married one day , just to see .
tell me , is your tardy master close at hand ?
do you know his plans ?
but please , tell me : is he coming home ?
it seems he has taken great care to please his wife .
why , mistress , my master is as angry as a bull with horns .
you bastard !
i don ’ t mean he ’ s
my mistress , ” i said .
damn your mistress !
my master said it .
i don ’ t know , ” he said , “ any house , wife , or mistress . ” my message , which was supposed to be delivered with my mouth , ended up being carried back home by my shoulders .
go back again , slave , and bring him home .
go back again , to be beaten home again ?
for god ’ s sake , send somebody else .
go back , slave , or i ’ ll knock you one across the head .
get out of here , you blathering peasant !
bring your master home .
you kick me out , he kicks me back .
look at you !
you have impatience all over your face .
he feels the need to grace all his other tramps with his presence while i sit at home starving for a smile from him .
has homely old age taken the alluring beauty from my poor cheeks ?
have i lost my wit ?
one smile from him would repair my decayed beauty .
but like an unruly deer , he ’ s always trespassing past the park borders and straying away from home to feed in new pastures .
i am nothing but a poor , used fool .
drive it out of you .
i know his eyes are worshiping some other woman , or why wouldn ’ t he be here ?
sister , you know he promised to give me a necklace .
i would gladly do without that if he would only stay faithful to me .
even the best jewel can be tarnished .
and no man with a reputation will tarnish that name with lies and bad behavior .
since my beauty no longer pleases my husband , i ’ ll weep away what ’ s left and then die with weeping .
how many infatuated people go mad with jealousy !
give me the death sentence and end all my troubles .
ever since these deadly conflicts erupted between your violent countrymen and ours , both you syracusians and we ephesians have held serious councils and decided not to permit any travel between our two hostile towns .
therefore , by law , you are condemned to die .
the gold i gave dromio is safe and sound at the centaur , and the inn host says that dromio has left and is looking for me .
i haven ’ t spoken to him since i sent him away from the marketplace earlier .
here he comes .
so , sir .
are you over your ridiculous mood ?
you never heard of the centaur ?
you weren ’ t given any gold ?
your mistress sent for me to come to dinner ?
the phoenix is my house ?
were you mad when you spoke to me so madly ?
said what , sir ?
when did i say all that ?
i haven ’ t seen you since you sent me to the centaur with the gold you gave me .
and i hope you realized i wasn ’ t very happy about it .
i ’ m glad to see you in such a merry mood .
but what ’ s the joke ?
please , master , tell me .
what , are you mocking me to my face ?
here .
take that , and that !
stop , sir , for god ’ s sake !
now this joke has turned serious .
why are you doing this ?
just because i act familiar with you sometimes and let you fool around and joke with me , you try to take advantage of my affection .
you call it my “ don ’ t you know ?
should i tell you why ?
well , thank you .
because you gave me something for nothing .
next time i ’ ll give you nothing for something .
is it lunchtime ?
what would that be ?
a basting .
well , then it will be dry .
if it is , i suggest you don ’ t eat it .
why not ?
because it will make you angry , and that will get me another beating .
well , learn to make jokes at the appropriate time .
there ’ s a time for all things .
before you got so angry , i never would have thought that .
why not ?
i ’ ll tell you : it ’ s because of a law as plain as father time ’ s bald head .
let ’ s hear it .
there may be a time for everything , but no man who has gone bald naturally can get his hair back .
why is time so cheap about giving out hair ?
but a lot of men have more hair than intelligence .
so then , you must think that hairy men are honest and simpleminded .
two reasons .
and good ones , too .
not good ones , please .
then sure ones .
no , not sure ones when we ’ re talking about something unsure .
then certain ones .
name them .
one , so they can save the money they spent on hairstyling , and two , so that when their hair falls out it doesn ’ t land in their dinner .
you were supposed to be proving that there isn ’ t time for everything .
then i ’ ll change it to this : father time himself is bald , so for all time there will be bald men .
how is it , my husband — oh , how is it — that you have become a stranger to yourself ?
ah , don ’ t tear yourself away from me !
i don ’ t know you .
why are you treating my sister like this ?
she sent dromio to bring you home for lunch .
dromio ?
and this is what you told me he said : that he beat you and pretended his house wasn ’ t his and i wasn ’ t his wife .
did you talk with this woman ?
what kind of scheme do you have going together ?
me , sir ?
i never saw her till now .
you said those exact things to me back in the marketplace .
i never talked with her in my life .
what , was i married to her in a dream ?
or am i asleep now and imagining all this ?
what is making our eyes and ears act so strangely ?
until i know for sure , i ’ ll humor her .
dromio , tell the servants to prepare for lunch .
oh , i wish i had my rosary !
i ’ ll cross myself .
this must be some kind of fairyland .
oh , spite of spites !
if we don ’ t obey them , they ’ ll suck the life out of us or pinch us black and blue .
why are you mumbling to yourself instead of answering the order i gave you ?
dromio , you drone , you snail , you slug , you idiot !
i ’ ve been transformed somehow , haven ’ t i , master ?
no , master , i ’ ve been changed in both mind and body .
that ’ s true .
i must be as stupid as an ass — that ’ s why i don ’ t know her , but she knows me .
i won ’ t play the fool anymore and just cry while my husband and his man laugh at me .
come , husband , let ’ s go to lunch .
husband , i ’ ll eat with you in private today and hear your confession about all the pranks you ’ ve pulled .
am i on earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
know myself !
master , should i watch the door ?
yes , and don ’ t let anyone come in , or else i ’ ll break your head .
well , syracusian , tell us – briefly – why you left your hometown and came to ephesus .
and yet i would have made her happy had our luck not been so bad .
in the same hour , and in the same inn , a poor woman also delivered identical twin boys .
reluctantly , i agreed – alas !
too quickly , we boarded a ship .
signior angelo , please excuse us .
here ’ s the story we ’ ll tell her : that i was with you at your shop , watching you make her necklace , and that you ’ re going to deliver it tomorrow .
say what you want , but i know what i know .
i think you ’ re an ass .
signior balthasar , you look upset .
your delicacies aren ’ t worth as much to me as your welcome is .
good food ’ s not a big deal — everyone can afford that .
and everyone can say “ welcome , ” which is just a word .
a little food and a huge welcome makes a joyous feast .
sure , to a cheap host and an even cheaper guest .
but look , even if my dishes are poor , eat them with my best wishes .
you may come across better food , but not a warmer welcome .
what ’ s this ?
my door is locked .
maud , bridget , marian , ciceley , gillian , ginn !
my master is standing out in the street !
who ’ s in there ?
hey , open the door !
a reason ?
so i can eat lunch .
i haven ’ t eaten today .
who do you think you are , keeping me out of my own house ?
you ’ ve stolen both my job and my name !
oh , lord , this makes me laugh !
i ’ ll come at you with the old proverb : “ should i make myself at home ? ”
listen up , you slave .
are you going to let us in ?
come , help me bang on the door , master .
well done !
we answered them , blow for blow .
you good-for-nothing , let me in .
master , knock hard upon the door .
if i break the door down , slave , you ’ ll be sorry for this .
is that you , wife ?
you could have come sooner .
if she punishes you , master , she ’ s sure to punish me .
we argued about which was best , and now we won ’ t get either one .
and if your clothes were as thin as mine , you ’ d really feel the air .
the food inside is warm , but you ’ re out here freezing .
it would make any man as mad as a bull to be betrayed like this .
go get me something i can use to break down the door .
i ’ ve had enough of this “ off with you ! ” come on , let me in !
well , i ’ m going to break in .
go get me a crow .
a crow without feathers ?
master , do you really mean that ?
i meant a crowbar .
get going already .
be patient , sir !
don ’ t do this !
all this suggests that she has a good reason for doing this to you .
let ’ s assume that she has a reason , which you don ’ t know yet : have faith that she ’ ll eventually explain why she shut the doors on you today .
you ’ re right — i ’ ll go quietly .
and even though i ’ m in a distasteful mood , i ’ ll work on being happy .
i know a terrific wench .
we ’ ll eat at her place .
i swear to her that i haven ’ t , but it doesn ’ t change anything .
i ’ ll meet you there in an hour .
do that .
this little prank of hers is going to cost me .
is the building of your love already in ruins ?
if you married my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth ’ s sake , treat her with more kindness .
what foolish thief brags about his crimes ?
it ’ s doubly wrong to cheat on your wife and then let her see the offense in your eyes .
we follow in your orbit , and you have the power to move us .
so , my sweet brother-in-law , go inside .
sweet mistress — i don ’ t know what other name to give you , or how you ’ ve figured out mine — you seem as
wise and graceful as the earth is wonderful and divine .
teach me how i should think and speak .
why would you have me betray the truth of my emotions and make my love wander in some other direction ?
are you a god ?
are you trying to remake me ?
go ahead , i ’ ll yield to your power .
but if i am myself , then i know for sure that your weeping sister is not my wife .
i don ’ t owe her any duty — it ’ s you that i submit to .
oh , sweet mermaid , don ’ t command me to drown myself in the flood of your sister ’ s tears .
are you insane , talking like this ?
your eyes are playing tricks on you .
that ’ s because you are near me , and you ’ re as dazzling as the sun .
why are you calling me “ love ” ?
call my sister that .
your sister ’ s sister .
that ’ s my sister .
my sister is all those things , or else she should be .
call yourself your own sister , because i want you .
give me your hand .
oh , wait , sir .
stay here .
i ’ ll go get my sister and see what she thinks .
what ’ s going on , dromio ?
where are you running so fast ?
do you know me ?
am i dromio ?
am i your servant ?
am i myself ?
it carried us toward corinth – or so we thought .
but before they reached us – let me say no more !
you are dromio , you are my servant , and you are yourself .
i ’ m an ass , i ’ m a woman ’ s servant , and i ’ m beside myself .
what woman ’ s servant ?
what do you mean , beside yourself ?
how does she claim to own you ?
i don ’ t mean that she wants me because what ’ s she like ?
the only thing i could do with her is to use all that oil as fuel in a lamp and then use that light to run away by .
her
even if she lives till the end of the world , she ’ d keep burning an additional week .
what ’ s her skin like ?
it ’ s dark , like my shoe .
some water will fix that .
no , it ’ s permanent .
what ’ s her name ?
nell .
she ’ s round , like a globe .
what part of her body is ireland ?
her bottom .
honestly , i didn ’ t see it , but i felt it in her hot breath .
where ’ s america and the west indies ?
oh , sir , on her nose , which is covered with pimples , sores , and red welts .
and i think that if i hadn ’ t been brave and strong , she would have turned me into a dog and made me her slave .
if there ’ s enough wind for a ship to sail out tonight , i won ’ t spend tonight in this town .
if a ship ’ s leaving , come to the marketplace .
if everyone here knows us but we don ’ t know anybody , it ’ s time , i think , for us to pack our bags and take off .
i ’ ll run from this woman who claims to be my wife as fast as i ’ d run from a bear .
that means it ’ s high time for me to go .
that woman who claims i am her husband — i loathe her in my soul .
i ’ d better stop up my ears against this siren ’ s song .
i know that , sir .
look , here ’ s the necklace .
what do you want me to do with this ?
whatever you want — i made it for you .
made it for me ?
i didn ’ t order it .
you did — not just once or twice , but twenty times .
you ’ re a funny man , sir .
take care .
i don ’ t know what to think about this .
i ’ ll go wait for dromio at the marketplace .
if any ships are sailing , i ’ ll get right on one .
antipholus owes me the exact amount that i owe you .
at five o 'clock he ’ s going to pay me for it .
please , come to his house with me .
the total due is about three ducats more than i owe this gentleman .
please , pay him immediately .
i don ’ t have the cash right now .
besides , i have some business to take care of in town .
so you ’ ll bring the necklace to her yourself ?
all right , sir , i will .
do you have it with you ?
listen , please , give me the necklace .
the wind is right and it ’ s high tide , and i ’ ve delayed him a long time already .
good lord !
you ’ re using this as an excuse for not showing up at the porcupine like you promised .
i should have reprimanded you then for not bringing it , but you started fighting with me first .
it ’ s getting late .
please , sir , hurry up .
antipholus , you hear how the man pleads with me .
give me the necklace !
give it to my wife , and get your money .
come , come .
you know i gave it to you just now .
send the necklace to her , or send me with a token that will authorize her to pay me .
damn it , this isn ’ t funny .
where ’ s the necklace ?
let me see it .
pay you ?
what should i pay you ?
the money you owe me for the necklace .
i owe you nothing until i receive the necklace .
you know that i gave it to you a half hour ago .
you wrong me even more , sir , by denying it .
consider how poorly this reflects on me .
i will .
this harms my reputation .
pay for something i never got ?
go ahead , you fool .
arrest me if you dare .
i would have my own brother arrested if he treated me so terribly .
you ’ re under arrest , sir .
you hear the charges .
i ’ ll obey you until i can make bail .
but angelo , you ’ ll pay for this , even if it costs all the precious metals in your jewelry shop .
sir , the laws of ephesus will be on my side , and you ’ ll be embarrassed .
no , keep going , old man ; don ’ t stop like that .
for we may take pity on you , even if we can ’ t pardon you .
had the gods taken pity on us , i wouldn ’ t be here calling them merciless .
it ’ s been my bad luck to remain alive long enough to be able to tell the sad stories of my own misfortunes .
and for the sake of those you grieve for , do me a favor : tell me the full story of what has happened to you and them , up to this point .
i ’ ve left our luggage on the ship , and i bought the oil , balm , and liquor you wanted .
you annoying idiot , what epidamnum ship is waiting for me ?
a ship you sent me to find , to book passage out of here .
you drunken slave , i sent you for a rope , and i told you what to do with it .
yeah , right — you sent me to get whipped .
you sent me to the port to find a ship .
i ’ ll debate this with you later , and then i ’ ll teach you to listen more carefully .
go to adriana , you scoundrel , and quickly .
give her this key , and tell her that there ’ s money in the desk that ’ s covered with a turkish tapestry .
have her send it to me .
tell her that i ’ ve been arrested and the money will be my bail .
hurry , you slave !
go !
to adriana ?
where that “ sweetheart ” said i was her husband !
she ’ s too much for me to handle .
but i must go there , against my will : servants must fulfill their masters ' wishes .
oh , luciana , did he tempt you like that ?
sad or happy ?
first , he said you had no right to him .
he meant he did nothing right for me — which is true , unfortunately .
then he swore he was a stranger here .
and that ’ s true — he then i pleaded for you .
and what did he say ?
that he felt for me the love that i begged him to feel for you .
how did he try to persuade you to love him ?
have some patience , please .
then why be jealous of a person like that ?
when an evil thing has been lost , no one cries .
oh , but i think of him more highly than i say i do — and i wish he looked worse in other women ’ s eyes .
my heart adores him , even though my tongue curses him .
how did you lose your breath ?
by running fast .
where ’ s your master , dromio ?
is he all right ?
no , he ’ s in a place worse than hell .
a backbiting friend , one who grabs people , who patrols the streets and passageways .
speak , man , what ’ s the matter ?
tell me , who had him arrested ?
i don ’ t know who had him arrested , but the man that arrested him was in a suit of leather .
get it , sister .
how could he be in debt without me knowing it ?
don ’ t you hear it ring ?
what , the necklace ?
no , no , the bell .
it ’ s time for me to go .
it was two o 'clock when i left him , and now it ’ s one .
i ’ ve never heard of that .
of course .
you sell fish .
no , not me , sir .
in that case i wish you were as good a man as a fish seller .
good , sir ?
yes , sir .
only one man in ten thousand is good in this world .
that ’ s definitely true , my lord .
since if the sun breeds maggots on a dead dog , kissing the corpse — by the way , do you have a daughter ?
i do indeed , my lord .
then by all means never let her walk in public .
procreation is a good thing , but if your daughter gets pregnant … look out , friend .
a lot of words .
and what is the subject ?
between whom ?
i mean , what do the words say ?
oh , just lies , sir .
into my grave .
well , that ’ s certainly out of this world , all right .
you can ’ t take anything from me that i care less about — except my life , except my life , except my life .
good-bye , my lord .
you ’ re looking for lord hamlet .
he ’ s right over there .
thank you , sir .
my lord !
my dear sir !
ah , my good old friends !
how are you , guildenstern ?
and rosencrantz !
boys , how are you both doing ?
happy that we ’ re not too happy , lucky in being not too lucky .
but you ’ re not down and out , either , are you ?
so you ’ re around lady luck ’ s waist ?
yes , we ’ re the privates in her army .
anyway , what ’ s up ?
but you ’ re wrong .
let me ask you a particular question .
what crimes have you committed to be sent here to this prison ?
prison , my lord ?
denmark ’ s a prison .
then i guess the whole world is one .
yes , quite a large one , with many cells and dungeons , denmark being one of the worst .
we don ’ t think so , my lord .
well , then it isn ’ t one to you , since nothing is really good or bad in itself — it ’ s all what a person thinks about it .
and to me , denmark is a prison .
that must be because you ’ re so ambitious .
it ’ s too small for your large mind .
dreams are a sign of ambition , since ambition is nothing more than the shadow of a dream .
but a dream itself is just a shadow .
in fact , i consider ambition to be so light and airy that it ’ s only the shadow of a shadow .
then i guess beggars are the ones with bodies , while ambitious kings and heroes are just the shadows of beggars .
should we go inside ?
well , then , i thank you , though i ’ m such a beggar that even my thanks are not worth much .
or was it just your whim , on your own initiative ?
what should we say , my lord ?
you were sent for .
i know the king and queen sent for you .
why would they do that , my lord ?
that ’ s what i want you to tell me .
my lord , we were sent for .
is something about to happen that warrants working this night and day ?
who can explain this to me ?
i can .
or at least i can describe the rumors .
so why did you laugh when i said that men don ’ t interest me ?
the one who plays the part of the king will be particularly welcome .
which troupe is it ?
the tragic actors from the city , the ones you used to enjoy so much .
what are they doing on the road ?
they made more money and got more attention in the city .
but things have changed there , and it ’ s easier for them on the road now .
are they as popular as they used to be when i lived in the city ?
do they attract big audiences ?
no , not like before .
why ?
are they getting rusty ?
no , they ’ re busy and as excellent as ever .
the problem is that they have to compete with a group of children who yell out their lines and receive outrageous applause for it .
these child actors are now in fashion , and they ’ ve so overtaken the public theaters that society types hardly come at all , they ’ re so afraid of being mocked by the playwrights who write for the boys .
what , you mean kid actors ?
who takes care of them ?
who pays their way ?
will they stop working when their voices mature ?
aren ’ t the playwrights hurting them by making them upstage adult actors , which they are going to grow up and become ?
there ’ s been a whole debate on the topic .
for a while , no play was sold to the theaters without a big fight between the children ’ s playwright and the actors playing adult roles .
are you kidding ?
oh , there ’ s been a lot of quarreling .
and the boys are winning so far ?
actually , it ’ s not so unusual when you think about it .
my uncle is king of denmark , and the same people who made fun of him while my father was still alive are now rushing to pay twenty , forty , fifty , a hundred ducats apiece for miniature portraits of him .
there ’ s something downright unnatural about it , if a philosopher stopped to think about it .
the actors are here .
gentlemen , welcome to elsinore .
don ’ t be shy — shake hands with me .
and if we don ’ t shake hands , when i act all nice to the players it will seem like i ’ m happier to see them than you .
you are very welcome here .
but still , my uncle-father and aunt-mother have got the wrong idea .
in what sense , my lord ?
i ’ m only crazy sometimes .
at other times , i know what ’ s what .
gentlemen , i hope you are well .
listen , guildenstern , and you too , rosencrantz — listen as close as you can !
yes , the second time around , since , as they say , old people become children again .
my lord , i have news for you .
my lord , i have news for you .
when roscius was an actor in ancient rome — the actors have arrived , my lord .
yawn , snore .
i swear — — each actor arrived on his ass .
well , aren ’ t i right , jephthah , old man ?
if you ’ re calling me jephthah , my lord , i do have a daughter i love more than anything , yes .
what is logical , then , my lord ?
why ,
welcome , welcome to all of you .
which speech , my lord ?
but the critics and i found it to be an excellent play , with well-ordered scenes that were clever but not fancy .
i loved one speech in particular .
this speech is going on too long .
we ’ ll have the barber trim it later , along with your beard .
the muffled queen ” ?
that ’ s good .
the muffled queen ” is good .
look how flushed the actor is , with tears in his eyes .
my lord , i will give them all they deserve .
good heavens , man , give them more than that !
treat them with honor and dignity .
the less they deserve , the more your generosity is worth .
lead them inside .
come , everyone .
follow him , friends .
we ’ ll watch a whole play tomorrow .
yes , my lord .
then we ’ ll see that tomorrow night .
by the way , if i were to compose an extra speech of twelve to sixteen lines and stick it into the play , you could learn it by heart for tomorrow , right ?
yes , my lord .
very well .
follow that gentleman now , and be careful not to make fun of him .
my good friends , i ’ ll see you tomorrow .
welcome to elsinore .
yes , my lord .
now i ’ m alone .
oh , what a mean low-life i am !
for hecuba !
the ghost is definitely something to worry about .
wait , look !
it has come again .
i ’ ll meet it if it ’ s the last thing i do .
if you have a voice or can make sounds , speak to me .
am i a coward ?
pull off my beard ?
pinch my nose ?
call me the worst liar ?
bloody , inhuman villain !
remorseless , treacherous , sex-obsessed , unnatural villain !
ah , revenge !
what an ass i am .
damn it !
murder has no tongue , but miraculously it still finds a way to speak .
if he becomes pale , i know what to do .
i need better evidence than the ghost to work with .
the play ’ s the thing to uncover the conscience of the king .
and you can ’ t put your heads together and figure out why he ’ s acting so dazed and confused , ruining his peace and quiet with such dangerous displays of lunacy ?
did he treat you well when you saw him ?
yes , in a very gentlemanly way .
he didn ’ t ask questions , but answered ours at length .
madam , some actors happened to cross our paths on the way here .
they are here at court now , and i believe they ’ ve been told to give a performance for him tonight .
it ’ s true , and he asked me to beg you both to attend .
it makes me very happy to hear he ’ s so interested .
gentlemen , please try to sharpen his interest even more , and let this play do him some good .
we will , my lord .
yes , i ’ ll go .
i hope so too , madam .
ophelia , come here . — i hear him coming .
quick , let ’ s hide , my lord .
dying , sleeping — that ’ s all dying is — a sleep that ends all the heartache and shocks that life on earth gives us — that ’ s an achievement to wish for .
to die , to sleep — to sleep , maybe to dream .
that ’ s the consideration that makes us stretch out our sufferings so long .
but hello , my lord , how have you been doing lately ?
very well , thank you .
well , well , well .
my lord , i have some mementos of yours that i ’ ve been meaning to give back to you for a long time now .
please take them .
there , my lord .
ha ha , are you good ?
excuse me ?
are you beautiful ?
my lord , what are you talking about ?
i ’ m just saying that if you ’ re good and beautiful , your goodness should have nothing to do with your beauty .
but could beauty be related to anything better than goodness ?
sure , since beauty ’ s power can more easily change a good girl into a whore than the power of goodness can change a beautiful girl into a virgin .
this used to be a great puzzle , but now i ’ ve solved it .
i used to love you .
you certainly made me believe you did , my lord .
i didn ’ t love you .
then i guess i was misled .
get yourself to a
i am arrogant , vengeful , ambitious , with more ill will in me than i can fit into my thoughts , and more than i have time to carry it out in .
why should people like me be crawling around between earth and heaven ?
every one of us is a criminal .
don ’ t believe any of us .
hurry to a convent .
where ’ s your father ?
he ’ s at home , my lord .
lock him in , so he can play the fool in his own home only .
good-bye .
oh , dear god , please help him !
get yourself to a convent , at once .
good-bye .
good-bye .
dear god , please make him normal again !
i ’ ve heard all about you women and your cosmetics too .
god gives you one face , but you paint another on top of it .
you dance and prance and lisp ; you call god ’ s creations by pet names , and you excuse your sexpot ploys by pleading ignorance .
come on , i won ’ t stand for it anymore .
it ’ s driven me crazy .
i hereby declare we will have no more marriage .
whoever is already married ( except one person i know ) will stay married — all but one person .
everyone else will have to stay single .
get yourself to a convent , fast .
love ?
his feelings don ’ t move in that direction .
with any luck , the sea and new countries will push out these thoughts that have somehow taken root in his mind .
what do you think of this plan ?
it should work .
but i still believe that his madness was caused by unrequited love . — hello , ophelia .
you don ’ t have to tell us what lord hamlet said .
i ’ ll hide and listen in .
if she can ’ t find out what his secret is , then send him off to england or wherever you think best .
that ’ s how we ’ ll do it , then .
if there ’ s any good deed i can do that will bring you peace and me honor , speak to me .
or if you ’ ve got some buried treasure somewhere , which they say often makes ghosts restless , then tell us about it .
stay and speak !
keep it from leaving , marcellus .
should i strike it with my spear ?
yes , if it doesn ’ t stand still .
it ’ s over here .
there it is .
it ’ s gone .
it was about to say something when the rooster crowed .
perform the speech just as i taught you , musically and smoothly .
i would whip a guy for making a tyrant sound too tyrannical .
please avoid doing that .
i will , sir .
but don ’ t be too tame , either — let your good sense guide you .
i hope we ’ ve corrected that fault pretty well in our company , sir .
oh , correct it completely .
yes , he will , and the queen as well .
tell the actors to hurry .
will you two help them get ready ?
yes , my lord .
well , hello there , horatio !
here i am at your service , my dear lord .
horatio , you ’ re the best man i ’ ve ever known .
oh , sir — don ’ t think i ’ m flattering you .
what could i hope to get from you , who ’ ve got nothing but your charm to support you in life ?
why would anyone flatter a poor person ?
no , keep flattery for kissing the hands of those who can pay well .
you understand ?
watch him closely .
they ’ re coming .
i can ’ t talk now .
take your seat .
so how ’ s my nephew hamlet doing ?
wonderful !
i eat the air , like chameleons do .
i ’ m positively stuffed with air , i eat so much of it .
i have no idea what you ’ re talking about , hamlet .
you ’ re not answering my question .
mine , neither .
indeed i did , my lord .
what role did you play ?
i played julius caesar .
i was killed in the capitol .
brutus killed me .
yes , my lord .
they ’ re ready whenever you are .
no thanks , my good mother .
there ’ s a nicer piece of work right here .
my lady , should i lie in your lap ?
no , my lord .
i mean , with my head in your lap ?
yes , my lord .
did you think i was talking about sex ?
what is , my lord ?
nothing .
you ’ re in a good mood tonight , my lord .
who , me ?
yes , my lord .
oh god — who is , by the way , the best comic of them all .
what can you do but be happy ?
look how cheerful my mother is , only two hours after my father died .
no , my lord , it ’ s been four months .
as long as that ?
i ’ ll get myself a fur-trimmed suit .
in that case , there ’ s reason to hope a man ’ s memory may outlive him by six months .
this means we ’ re having some mischievous fun .
this pantomime was probably a summary of the play .
this guy will tell us everything .
actors can ’ t keep a secret .
they ’ ll tell all .
will he tell us what that pantomime meant ?
sure , or anything else you show him .
as long as you aren ’ t ashamed to show it , he won ’ t be ashamed to tell you what it means .
you ’ re naughty .
i ’ m watching the play .
was that the prologue or the inscription on some wedding ring ?
it was a bit short , my lord .
yes , as short as a woman ’ s love .
madam , how are you liking this play ?
the lady ’ s overdoing it , i think .
oh , but she ’ ll keep her word .
is there anything offensive in it ?
not offensive at all .
what ’ s the play called ?
yes , it faded away when the rooster crowed .
don ’ t you agree that we owe it to him to tell him about this , out of duty and love ?
i could even supply the dialogue between you and your lover if you did your little puppet show of love for me .
we ’ re all waiting for the revenge !
the original story was written in the finest italian .
you ’ ll see shortly how the murderer wins the love of gonzago ’ s wife .
the king is getting up .
what — is he scared of a gun that only fired a blank ?
my lord , how are you feeling ?
get me out of here !
lights , lights , get us some lights !
no , a whole share for me .
did you notice ?
yes , i did , my lord .
when the actors were talking about poison ?
i watched him very closely .
ah ha !
hey , let ’ s have some music here !
play your flutes !
come on , music !
my lord , could i have a word with you ?
you can have a whole story , not just a word .
sir , the king — yes , what about him ?
he ’ s in his chambers now , and he ’ s extremely upset .
i ’ ll be good , sir .
go ahead .
the queen your mother is upset , and sent me to see you .
it ’ s lovely to see you .
no , my lord , your polite words are not to the point .
if you could please stop fooling around , i ’ ll tell you what your mother wants .
if not , i ’ ll leave you alone and that ’ ll be the end of my business .
sir , i can ’ t .
can ’ t what , my lord ?
stop fooling around .
my mind is confused .
okay , to the point .
oh , what a wonderful son , i can impress my mother !
but what ’ s the upshot of her admiration ?
do tell .
she wants to have a word with you in her bedroom before you go to bed .
i ’ d obey even if she were my mother ten times over .
is there anything else i can do for you ?
my lord , you used to like me .
and still do , i swear by my hands .
my lord , what ’ s wrong with you ?
sir , i have no future ahead of me .
but how can you say that , when the king himself says you ’ re the heir to the danish throne ?
i don ’ t really understand what you mean .
will you play this recorder ?
i can ’ t , my lord .
please .
i ’ m serious , i can ’ t .
i ’ m begging you .
i have no idea how .
oh , it ’ s as easy as lying .
but i can ’ t play a melody .
i don ’ t know how .
my god , do you think i ’ m easier to manipulate than a pipe ?
you can push my buttons , but you can ’ t play me for a fool .
hello and god bless you , sir .
my lord , the queen wants to speak with you right away .
do you see that cloud up there that looks like a camel ?
by god , it does look like a camel .
to me it looks like a weasel .
it does have a back like a weasel ’ s .
or like a whale .
yes , very much like a whale .
i ’ ll go see my mother soon .
i ’ ll tell her .
this is the time of night when witches come out , when graveyards yawn open and the stench of hell seeps out .
i could drink hot blood and do such terrible deeds that people would tremble even in the daylight .
i ’ ll speak as sharp as a dagger to her , but i won ’ t use one on her .
and so , my words and thoughts will be at odds .
i don ’ t like the way he ’ s acting , and it ’ s not safe for me to let his insanity get out of control .
so get prepared .
i ’ m sending you to england on diplomatic business , and hamlet will go with you .
as king , i cannot risk the danger he represents as he grows crazier by the hour .
we ’ ll take care of it .
when a great leader dies he doesn ’ t die alone but , like a whirlpool , draws others with him .
he ’ s like a huge wheel on the top of the highest mountain whose spokes touch the rim of ten thousand smaller things — when it falls down the mountain , every little object goes down with it .
whenever a king sighs , everyone groans .
prepare yourself , please , for this trip .
we ’ ll put a leash on this danger that ’ s now running wild .
we ’ ll hurry .
my lord , hamlet ’ s going to his mother ’ s room .
i ’ ll hide behind the tapestry to hear what they say .
i bet she ’ ll chew him out .
and as you said ( and you said it wisely ) , it ’ s good to have someone other than a mother listening in on them , since she can be too partial to him .
goodbye , my lord .
i ’ ll stop by before you go to bed , and tell you what i ’ ve heard .
thanks , my dear lord .
it has the mark of
so much for fortinbras .
that won ’ t work , since i ’ m still reaping the rewards of that murder : my crown and my queen .
can a person be forgiven and still keep the fruits of his crime ?
in this wicked world , criminals often take the money they stole and use it to buy off the law , shoving justice aside .
but not in heaven .
what is there left to do ?
but it can ’ t help either !
my heart ’ s as black as death .
my soul is stuck to sin , and the more it struggles to break free , the more it sticks .
help me , angels !
c ’ mon , make an effort .
i could do it easily now .
he ’ s praying now .
and now i ’ ll do it .
he ’ ll come right away .
i ’ ll be right here , silent .
have you forgotten who i am ?
no , sit down .
what are you going to do ?
you won ’ t kill me , will you ?
repent and avoid damnation .
good night to you .
who would do that ?
what is it , laertes ?
what would you like , laertes ?
please , let me go .
i have to go to england , don ’ t you know that ?
what , gertrude ?
how is hamlet ?
oh , this is terrible !
his wildness is a threat to all of us — to you , to me , to everyone .
i ’ ve gotten it dirty — ashes to ashes , and dust to dust .
believe what ?
besides , you ’ re a sponge !
you think i ’ m a sponge , my lord ?
i ’ m glad about that .
a thing of no importance .
how dangerous to have this madman on the loose !
but a terminal disease requires extreme treatment , or nothing at all .
but where is he ?
bring him to me .
at dinner .
what do you mean by that ?
where is polonius ?
in heaven .
so get ready to leave .
good .
don ’ t waste any time .
i ’ ll tell him , my lord .
go ahead , then .
is he attacking the heartland of poland or some frontier ?
in the end i grudgingly consented .
i hereby grant your request , and hope you have a good time .
so why does it seem so particular to you ?
so then the poles won ’ t be willing to defend it .
good-bye , sir .
start without me .
my god !
i have the motivation , the willpower , the ability , and the means to do it .
i won ’ t speak to her .
she ’ s insistent .
in fact , she ’ s crazed .
what does she want ?
show her in .
please just listen .
oh , ho !
may god be at your table .
come , driver !
good night , ladies , good night , sweet ladies , good night , good night .
follow her .
listen !
what is it ?
where ’ s this so-called king ?
please wait .
thank you .
let him go , gertrude .
where ’ s my father ?
he ’ s dead .
don ’ t mess with me .
only my free will — nothing else .
do you want to know who they are , then ?
what ’ s that noise ?
please remember , love .
it ’ s not manly .
and you ’ re right to do so .
please , come with me .
who are the people who want to speak with me ?
sailors , sir .
they say they have letters for you .
show them in .
hello , sir .
god bless you .
may he bless you , too .
he will , sir , if he wants to .
i have a lot to tell you about them .
good-bye .
it looks that way .
i didn ’ t see them .
laertes , i want you to hear what they say .
what does this mean ?
do you recognize the handwriting ?
naked , ” he says .
and in a p.s.
but let him come .
that ’ ll be fine .
all your talents and gifts didn ’ t arouse as much envy from him as this one quality did , though to me it ’ s far from your best attribute .
what quality is that , my lord ?
yes , from normandy .
yes , that ’ s the one .
i know him well .
he ’ s his homeland ’ s jewel .
how could you ask ?
that ’ s the right answer — it shows your love .
let ’ s go .
damn it !
but wait , what ’ s that sound ?
drowned ?
so she is drowned .
let ’ s follow him , gertrude .
let ’ s follow him .
here ’ s the water , right ?
is that how the law sees it ?
it sure is .
the coroner ’ s inquest law .
do you want to know the truth ?
well there , now you ’ ve said it .
come on , shovel .
they keep up adam ’ s profession .
what , aren ’ t you a christian ?
i ’ ll ask you another question .
if you can ’ t answer it — go ahead !
but how ?
ah , i ’ ve got it !
go ahead .
now go and get me some booze .
yes , exactly .
indeed , my lord .
exactly .
there ’ s another .
could that be a lawyer ’ s skull ?
no more than that , my lord .
yes , my lord , and calfskin too .
it ’ s mine , sir .
for no man , sir .
how literal this guy is !
you don ’ t know that ?
he ’ ll recover his sanity there .
why not ?
what do you mean , “ in a strange way ” ?
on what grounds ?
how long will a man lie in his grave before he starts to rot ?
a leathermaker will last nine years .
whose was it ?
a crazy bastard .
who do you think ?
i really don ’ t know .
damn that crazy madman !
this one ?
yes , that one .
are you sad about that ?
horatio , tell me something .
oh god , do i have to remember that ?
she would hang on to him , and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him ; she couldn ’ t get enough of him .
less than a month after my father ’ s death , even before the tears on her cheeks had dried , she remarried .
that ’ s not good , and no good can come of it either .
hello , sir .
nice to see you again , horatio — that is your name , right ?
that ’ s me , sir .
i ’ ll change that name for you .
hello , sir .
what ’ s that , my lord ?
do you think alexander the great looked like this when he was buried ?
exactly like that .
and smelled like that , too ?
whew !
just as bad , my lord .
how low we can fall , horatio .
isn ’ t it possible to imagine that the noble ashes of alexander the great could end up plugging a hole in a barrel ?
if you thought that you ’ d be thinking too much .
no , not at all .
the great emperor caesar , dead and turned to clay , might plug up a hole to keep the wind away .
oh , to think that the same body that once ruled the world could now patch up a wall !
but quiet , be quiet a minute .
here comes the king , the queen , and the noblemen of court .
who are they following ?
let ’ s stay and watch a while .
what other rites are you going to give her ?
she deserves to have rocks and stones thrown on her body .
but she has had prayers read for her and is dressed up like a pure virgin , with flowers tossed on her grave and the bell tolling for her .
isn ’ t there any other rite you can perform ?
no , nothing .
we would profane the other dead souls here if we sang the same requiem for her that we sang for them .
lay her in the ground , and let violets bloom from her lovely and pure flesh !
i ’ m telling you , you jerk priest , my sister will be an angel in heaven while you ’ re howling in hell .
sweet flowers for a sweet girl .
goodbye !
oh , damn three times , damn ten times the evil man whose wicked deed deprived you of your ingenious mind .
hold off burying her until i ’ ve caught her in my arms once more .
that ’ s no way to pray .
pull them apart .
oh , my son , what issue is that ?
i loved ophelia .
forty thousand brothers , if you added all their love together , couldn ’ t match mine .
what are you going to do for her ?
oh , he ’ s crazy , laertes !
for the love of god , be patient with him .
damn it , show me what you ’ re going to do for her .
will you cry ?
fight ?
stop eating ?
cut yourself ?
i ’ ll do all that .
and if you rattle on about mountains , then let them throw millions of acres over us .
this is pure insanity .
he ’ ll be like this for a little while .
then he ’ ll be as calm and quiet as a dove waiting for her eggs to hatch .
i always loved you .
but it doesn ’ t matter .
please , horatio , go with him .
who ’ s there ?
no , who are long live the king !
is that barnardo ?
yes , it ’ s me .
you ’ ve come right on time .
the clock ’ s just striking twelve .
go home to bed , francisco .
thanks for letting me go .
it ’ s bitterly cold out , and i ’ m depressed .
has it been a quiet night ?
i haven ’ t even heard a mouse squeak .
well , good night .
if you happen to see horatio and marcellus , who are supposed to stand guard with me tonight , tell them to hurry .
i think i hear them .
that ’ s enough about that .
now i ’ ll tell you the other story about my journey .
do you remember the circumstances ?
how could i forget , my lord !
there was a kind of war in my brain that wouldn ’ t let me sleep .
it was worse than being a captive in chains .
is it possible ?
yes , please tell me .
do you want to know what i wrote ?
yes , my lord .
i had my father ’ s signet ring in my pocket , with the royal seal of denmark on it .
i folded up the new document , signed it , sealed it , and put it safely back so that no one noticed any difference .
the next day we had our fight at sea , and you know what happened after that .
so rosencrantz and guildenstern are in for it .
man , they were asking for it .
i don ’ t feel guilty about them at all .
they got what they deserved .
it ’ s always dangerous when little people get caught in the crossfire of mighty opponents .
what a king claudius is !
isn ’ t it completely moral to kill him now with this sword — and an easy conscience ?
and wouldn ’ t i be damned if i let this monster live to do more harm ?
he ’ ll find out soon what happened in england .
soon enough .
but i have the meantime .
i ’ ll be nice to him .
it was just that the showiness of his grief sent me into a fury .
hang on a minute — who are you ?
welcome back to denmark , my lord .
thank you kindly , sir .
my lord , if you have a free moment , i have a message from his majesty .
no thank you , my lord .
it ’ s very hot .
it is rather cold , indeed , my lord .
and yet i feel it ’ s very hot and humid , which is bad for my complexion .
yes indeed it is , sir .
very humid , i can ’ t tell you how humid it is .
my lord , his majesty wanted me to tell you that he ’ s placed a large bet on you .
this is what it ’ s all about — please , i beg you — no , my lord , i ’ m comfortable like this , thank you .
sir , your description of him doesn ’ t detract from his good qualities , though i know that trying to list them all would make your head spin , and even so you wouldn ’ t be able to keep up with him .
i felt like skipping school , sir .
i wouldn ’ t allow your enemies to say that , and i won ’ t believe it from you .
i know you ’ d never skip school .
what are you doing here in elsinore ?
i ’ ll teach you to drink hard by the time you leave .
sir , we came to see your father ’ s funeral .
please , don ’ t make fun of me .
i think you came to see my mother ’ s wedding instead .
well , sir , it ’ s true it came soon after .
the leftovers from the funeral dinner made a convenient wedding banquet .
oh , i ’ d rather have met my fiercest enemy in heaven , horatio , than have lived through that terrible day !
my father — i think i see my father .
where , sir ?
in my imagination , horatio .
i saw him once .
he was an admirable king .
he was a great human being .
he was perfect in everything .
i ’ ll never see the likes of him again .
you speak absolutely correctly , sir .
and what ’ s the point , sir ?
why are we talking about him like this ?
sorry , sir ?
i know you know something — thanks for the compliment , i ’ m happy you know that .
but in fact it doesn ’ t say much .
i ’ m sorry , you were saying ?
i know you know something about how excellent laertes is —
i can ’ t admit that , since you ’ d have to compare his excellence to mine .
excellent in fencing , i mean , sir .
the rapier and the dagger .
those are only two of his weapons .
but , go on .
the king has bet six barbary horses , and he has prepared six french rapiers and daggers with all their accessories .
three of the carriages are very imaginatively designed , and they match the fencing accessories .
what do you mean by “ carriages ” ?
the carriages , sir , are the hangers — where the swords hang .
carriage ” makes it sound like it ’ s pulling around a cannon .
i prefer to call it a “ hanger . ” but anyway .
six barbary horses , six french swords with accessories , and three imaginatively designed carriages — sounds like a french bet against the danish .
why has all this been put on the table ?
the king , sir , has bet that in a dozen rounds between you and laertes , he won ’ t beat you by more than three hits .
but what if my answer ’ s no ?
it ’ s my exercise time .
my services are at your command .
thank you .
it ’ s a good thing he ’ s here to recommend himself .
no one else would .
he used to praise his mother ’ s nipple before he sucked it .
the king wishes to know if you want to play against him right away , or wait awhile .
i ’ ll do whatever the king wants .
if he ’ s ready now , so am i.
otherwise , i ’ ll do it anytime , as long as i ’ m able .
the king and queen are coming down with everyone else .
right on cue .
the queen wants you to chat with laertes — politely — before you begin your match .
she ’ s full of good advice .
you ’ re going to lose this bet , my lord .
i don ’ t think so .
i ’ ve been practicing fencing constantly since he went off to france .
with the handicap they ’ ve given me , i think i ’ ll win .
but i have a sinking feeling anyway .
oh well .
i ’ ll say you ’ re not feeling well .
you ’ ll do no such thing .
i thumb my nose at superstitions .
what ’ s important is to be prepared .
since nobody knows anything about what he leaves behind , then what does it mean to leave early ?
let it be .
come shake hands with laertes , hamlet .
i will accept no apology until experts in matters of honor show me how to make peace with you without staining my own reputation in doing so .
yes , hand me one too .
i ’ m going to make you look sharp , laertes .
you ’ re making fun of me .
no , i swear i ’ m not .
yes , my lord , quite well .
you ’ ve bet on the weaker fencer .
i ’ ve seen both of you fence .
but since laertes is better , we ’ ve given him a handicap .
yes , my lord .
put the goblets of wine on that table .
if hamlet makes the first or second hit , or gets back at laertes by making the third hit , then let my soldiers give him a military salute .
i ’ ll drink to hamlet ’ s health , and into his goblet i ’ ll drop a pearl even more costly than those in the crowns of the last four danish kings .
give me the goblets .
come on , sir .
come on , my lord .
that was one hit .
no , it wasn ’ t .
referee !
it was obviously a hit .
well , let ’ s go on .
give me a goblet . — hamlet , this pearl ’ s yours .
here ’ s to your health .
give him the goblet .
set it down awhile .
let ’ s play .
another hit .
what do you say ?
you got me , i admit it .
my son will win .
he ’ s flabby and out of breath . — here , hamlet , take my handkerchief and wipe your forehead .
the queen drinks to your good luck and happiness , hamlet .
thank you , madam .
gertrude , don ’ t drink that .
excuse me .
i ’ ll drink it if i like .
i ’ d better not drink now .
i ’ ll drink later .
come on , let me wipe your face .
i doubt it .
get ready for the third hit , laertes .
you ’ re just playing around .
come on , give me your best shot .
i sense you ’ re treating me like a child .
you think so ?
come on .
take this !
separate them .
they ’ re overdoing it .
no , come on , one more time .
take care of the queen !
both fencers are bleeding — how do you feel , my lord ?
how do you feel , laertes ?
like a mouse caught in my own trap , osric .
how ’ s the queen ?
she fainted at the sight of them bleeding .
the drink , the drink !
i ’ ve been poisoned .
oh , what evil !
lock the door .
we ’ ve been betrayed !
find out who did it !
i ’ m the one , hamlet .
hamlet , you ’ re dead .
no medicine in the world can cure you .
you don ’ t have more than half an hour to live .
the treacherous weapon is right in your hand , sharp and dipped in poison .
the foul plan backfired on me .
here i lie and will never get up again .
your mother ’ s been poisoned .
i can ’ t speak anymore .
the king , the king ’ s to blame .
then get to work , poison !
sir , i think i saw him last night .
saw who ?
the king my father ? !
just listen carefully while i tell you the amazing thing i saw , with these gentlemen as witnesses .
for god ’ s sake , let me hear it .
it just appeared before them and marched past them with slow dignity three times , a staff ’ s distance from their amazed eyes , while they turned , quaking with fear and too shocked to speak .
i knew your father .
but where did this happen ?
treason !
treason !
protect me , my friends .
i ’ ve only been hurt , not killed .
here , you goddamn incest-breeding danish murderer , drink this .
is your little pearl in there ?
follow my mother .
he got what he deserved .
he mixed that poison himself .
please forgive me as i forgive you , hamlet .
you ’ re not responsible for my death and my father ’ s , and i ’ m not responsible for yours .
god will free you from blame .
you ’ re alive .
not for a second .
i ’ m more like an ancient roman than a corrupt modern dane .
some of this liquor ’ s still left in the goblet .
please , give me that goblet , if you love me .
let go of it !
i ’ ll get it from you , i swear .
oh god , horatio , what a damaged reputation i ’ m leaving behind me , as no one knows the truth .
if you ever loved me , then please postpone the sweet relief of death awhile , and stay in this harsh world long enough to tell my story .
what are these warlike noises ?
young fortinbras , returning in triumph from poland , is firing his guns to greet the english ambassadors .
oh , i ’ m dying , horatio !
this strong poison ’ s overpowering me .
i will not live to hear the news from england .
but i bet fortinbras will win the election to the danish crown .
he ’ s got my vote as i die .
oh , oh , oh , oh .
what do i see here ?
what would you like to see ?
these corpses suggest mayhem .
oh , proud death , what banquet are you preparing that you ’ ve needed to knock off so many princes at one stroke ?
this is a horrible sight .
we meant to tell the king that his orders have been carried out , and rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead .
who will thank us now ?
as for me , i welcome my good luck with sadness .
let four captains carry hamlet like a soldier onto the stage .
military music and military rites will speak for his heroic qualities .
pick up the corpses .
on the platform where we stand guard , sir .
didn ’ t you talk to it ?
i did , sir , but it didn ’ t answer me .
that ’ s very strange .
i swear to god it ’ s true , sir .
we thought you ought to know about it .
yes , i should know , but it disturbs me .
are you on duty again tonight ?
yes , sir .
it was armed , you say ?
armed , sir .
from head to toe ?
yes , from top to bottom , sir .
so you couldn ’ t see his face , then ?
oh , yes , we could , sir .
he had his helmet visor up .
was he pale or flushed and red-faced ?
very pale , sir .
did he stare at you ?
the whole time .
i wish i ’ d been there .
did it stay a long time ?
about as long as it would take someone to count slowly to a hundred .
no , longer than that .
not the time i saw it .
his beard was gray , right ?
it was just like in real life , dark brown with silver whiskers in it .
i ’ ll stand guard with you tonight .
maybe it ’ ll come again .
i bet it will .
if it looks like my good father , i ’ ll speak to it , even if hell itself opens up and tells me to be quiet .
i ask you , if you ’ ve kept this a secret , keep doing so .
whatever happens tonight , don ’ t talk about it .
i ’ ll return the favor .
so good-bye for now .
i ’ ll see you on the guards ' platform between eleven and twelve tonight .
we ’ ll do our duty to you , sir .
give me your love instead , as i give you mine .
good-bye .
my father ’ s ghost — armed !
something ’ s wrong .
i suspect some foul play .
i wish the night were here already !
until then , i have to remain calm .
bad deeds will be revealed , no matter how people try to hide them .
my belongings are on the ship already .
good-bye .
and , my dear sister , as long as the winds are blowing and ships are sailing , let me hear from you — write .
do you doubt i ’ ll write ?
as for hamlet and his attentions to you , just consider it a big flirtation , the temporary phase of a hot-blooded youth .
it won ’ t last .
not a second more .
no more than a minute ?
then think about how shameful it would be for you to give in to his seductive talk and surrender your treasure chest to his greedy hands .
watch out , ophelia .
just keep your love under control , and don ’ t let yourself become a target of his lust .
baby blooms are most susceptible to disease .
so be careful .
fear will keep you safe .
young people often lose their self-control even without any help from others .
i ’ ll keep your words of wisdom close to my heart .
don ’ t worry , i won ’ t .
i ’ ve been here too long .
and here comes father .
you ’ re still here ?
shame on you — get on board !
the wind is filling your ship ’ s sail , and they ’ re waiting for you .
here , i give you my blessing again .
and just try to remember a few rules of life .
don ’ t say what you ’ re thinking , and don ’ t be too quick to act on what you think .
be friendly to people but don ’ t overdo it .
don ’ t be quick to pick a fight , but once you ’ re in one , hold your own .
listen to many people , but talk to few .
hear everyone ’ s opinion , but reserve your judgment .
good-bye , son .
your servants are waiting .
it ’ s locked away in my memory , and you ’ ve got the key .
good-bye .
what did he tell you , ophelia ?
something about hamlet .
if things are the way people tell me they are — and they ’ re only telling me this to warn me — then i have to say , you ’ re not conducting yourself with the self-restraint a daughter of mine should show .
what ’ s going on between you two ?
tell me the truth .
he ’ s offered me a lot of affection lately .
affection ! ” that ’ s nothing !
you ’ re talking like some innocent girl who doesn ’ t understand the ways of the world .
do you believe his “ offers , ” as you call them ?
i don ’ t know what to believe , father .
then i ’ ll tell you .
believe that you are a foolish little baby for believing these “ offers ” are something real .
offer yourself more respect , or — not to beat this word to death — you ’ ll offer me the chance to be a laughing-stock .
go on .
and he ’ s made the holiest vows to me , to back up what he says .
these vows are just traps for stupid birds .
i know when a man is on fire , he ’ ll swear anything .
remember that hamlet is young and has a lot more freedom to fool around than you do .
do as i say .
now come along .
i ’ ll do as you say , father .
friends of this country .
and servants of the danish king .
good night to you both .
good-bye .
who ’ s taken over the watch for you ?
barnardo ’ s taken my place .
good night .
is horatio here too ?
more or less .
so , tell us , did you see that thing again tonight ?
i haven ’ t seen anything .
horatio says we ’ re imagining it , and won ’ t let himself believe anything about this horrible thing that we ’ ve seen twice now .
that ’ s why i ’ ve begged him to come on our shift tonight , so that if the ghost appears he can see what we see and speak to it .
yes , it ’ s definitely nippy .
what time is it ?
a little before twelve , i think .
no , it ’ s just after twelve ; i heard the clock strike .
really ?
i didn ’ t hear it .
so it ’ s nearly the time when the ghost likes to appear .
what does that mean , sir ?
is that a tradition ?
yes , it is .
but though i was born here and should consider that tradition part of my own heritage , i think it would be better to ignore it than practice it .
other countries criticize us for our loud partying .
they call us drunks and insult our noble titles .
and our drunkenness does detract from our achievements , as great as they are , and lessens our reputations .
a tiny spot of evil casts doubt on their good qualities and ruins their reputations .
look , sir — here it comes !
oh angels , protect us !
whether you ’ re a good spirit or a cursed demon , whether you bring heavenly breezes or blasts of hell fire , whether your intentions are good or evil , you look so strange i want to talk to you .
i ’ ll call you “ hamlet senior , ” “ king , ” “ father , ” “ royal dane . ” answer me !
don ’ t drive me crazy with curiosity , but tell me why your church-buried bones have burst out of their coffin , and why your tomb ,
where we quietly buried you , has opened up its heavy marble jaws to spit you out again .
why ?
it wants you to go off with it , as if it wants to tell you something alone .
look how politely it ’ s pointing you to a place that ’ s farther away .
but don ’ t go .
definitely not .
don ’ t do it , sir .
why , what ’ s the danger ?
and as for my soul , how can the ghost endanger that , since it ’ s as immortal as the ghost is ?
look , it ’ s waving me over again .
i ’ ll follow it .
where it takes on some other horrible form that drives you insane .
think about it .
it ’ s still waving to me .
you ’ re not going , sir .
let go of me .
calm down .
you ’ re not going anywhere .
let me go , gentlemen .
i swear , if anyone holds me back , i ’ ll make a ghost of him !
his imagination is making him crazy .
let ’ s follow them .
it ’ s not right to obey his orders to let him go alone .
no , let ’ s follow him .
where are you taking me ?
speak .
listen to me .
i will .
the hour has almost come when i have to return to the horrible flames of purgatory .
ah , poor ghost !
speak .
i ’ m ready to hear you .
you must be ready for revenge , too , when you hear me out .
what ?
i ’ m the ghost of your father , doomed for a certain period of time to walk the earth at night , while during the day i ’ m trapped in the fires of purgatory until i ’ ve done penance for my past sins .
if i weren ’ t forbidden to tell you the secrets of
make your eyes jump out of their sockets , and your hair stand on end like porcupine quills .
but mortals like you aren ’ t allowed to hear this description of the afterlife .
listen , listen !
if you ever loved your poor dear father — oh god !
take revenge for his horrible murder , that crime against nature .
murder ?
his most horrible murder .
murder ’ s always horrible , but this one was especially horrible , weird , and unnatural .
you ’ d have to be as lazy as a weed on the shores of i knew it !
my uncle ?
oh , hamlet , how far she fell !
she went from me , who loved her with the dignity and devotion that suits a legitimate marriage , to a wretch whose natural gifts were poor compared to mine .
so let me be brief here .
and that ’ s how my brother robbed me of my life , my crown , and my queen all at once .
oh , it ’ s horrible , horrible , so horrible !
if you are human , don ’ t stand for it .
don ’ t let the danish king ’ s bed be a nest of incest .
leave her to god and her own guilt .
now , good-bye .
the glowworm ’ s light is beginning to fade , so morning is near .
good-bye , good-bye , good-bye .
remember me .
ah , all you up in heaven !
and earth !
what else ?
shall i include hell as well ?
damn it !
keep beating , my heart , and muscles , don ’ t grow old yet — keep me standing .
remember you !
yes , you poor ghost , as long as i have any power of memory in this distracted head .
remember you !
yes , by god !
oh , you evil woman !
oh , you villain , villain , you damned , smiling villain !
where ’ s my notebook ? — it ’ s a good idea for me to write down that one can smile and smile , and be a villain .
at least it ’ s possible in denmark .
he said , “ remember me . ” i swore i would .
sir , sir !
lord hamlet . — please let him be all right !
i ’ m all right .
oh-ho-ho , sir !
oh-ho-ho , kid !
come here .
so how did it go , sir ?
what happened , sir ?
it was incredible !
oh , please , tell us , sir .
i swear i won ’ t , sir .
i won ’ t either , sir .
okay .
but you promise you can keep a secret ?
yes , i swear .
sit down for a while , and we ’ ll tell you again the story you don ’ t want to believe , about what we ’ ve seen two nights now .
well , let ’ s sit down and listen to barnardo tell us .
last night , when that star to the west of the north star had traveled across the night sky to that point where it ’ s shining now , at one o 'clock , marcellus and i — quiet , shut up !
it ’ s come again .
looking just like the dead king .
very much so .
it ’ s terrifying .
it wants us to speak to it .
ask it something , horatio .
by god , i order you to speak .
any villain in denmark is going to be , well , a villain .
you don ’ t need a ghost returning from the grave to tell you that , sir .
yes , you ’ re absolutely right .
so , without further ado , the best thing to do now is probably just to shake hands and go our separate ways .
you go and take care of your business ( since everybody has some business to take care of , whatever it is worth ) , and i ’ ll go and pray .
you ’ re talking in such a crazy way , sir .
no offense taken .
ah , but there is , horatio , there ’ s a lot of offense .
as for this ghost we just saw , he ’ s a real one , i can tell you that much .
but regarding what happened between us , don ’ t ask — i can ’ t tell you .
and now , my friends , my courageous and educated friends , do me one small favor .
what is it , sir ?
of course we will .
don ’ t ever tell anyone what you ’ ve seen tonight .
we won ’ t , sir .
no , you have to swear it .
i swear to god i won ’ t .
me too , i won ’ t , i swear to god .
swear by my sword .
but we already swore , sir .
yes , but swear by my sword this time .
agree to swear .
you swear never to mention what you ’ ve seen .
swear by my sword .
come over here , gentlemen , and put your hands on my sword again .
swear by my sword you ’ ll never mention what you ’ ve heard .
you said it right , old mole .
what a tunneler !
let ’ s move again , my friends .
my god , this is unbelievably strange .
then give it a nice welcome , as you would give to any stranger .
there are more things in heaven and earth , horatio , than you ’ ve even dreamed of .
swear you won ’ t .
let ’ s go back to court together , but
give him this money and these letters , reynaldo .
i will , sir .
it would be wonderfully wise of you , my dear reynaldo , to ask around about his behavior a little before you visit him .
that ’ s what i thought too , sir .
excellent , very good .
do you get what i ’ m saying , reynaldo ?
yes , very well , sir .
you should say , “ i sort of know him , but not well .
isn ’ t he the one who ’ s always , ” and so on .
like gambling , sir ?
that ’ s right , or drinking , swearing , fist-fighting , visiting prostitutes — that kind of thing .
but that would ruin his reputation !
oh no , not if you say it right .
but , sir — why should you do this , you want to know ?
yes , sir .
i ’ d like to know .
yes , sir .
and then he ’ ll … he ’ ll … wait , what was i about to say ?
good god , i was about to say something .
what was i saying ?
you get my point , don ’ t you ?
yes , i do , sir .
god bless you .
have a safe trip .
thank you , sir .
i will , sir .
and i hope he ’ s studying his music like he ’ s supposed to .
got it , sir .
good-bye .
from what , in god ’ s name ?
is he crazy with love for you ?
what did he say ?
he stayed like that a long time .
finally , after shaking my arm a little , and jerking his head up and down three times , he sighed like it was his last breath .
come with me .
i ’ ll go tell the king about this .
love is such a violent emotion that it makes people self-destruct , as much as any strong emotion .
i ’ m so sorry .
that ’ s what made him crazy .
i regret not observing him more closely before i told you to do that .
i thought he was just toying with you and meant to ruin your reputation .
damn my suspicious thoughts !
it ’ s as common for us old people to assume we know more than we do as for young people to be too wild and crazy .
come on , let ’ s go see the king .
welcome , dear rosencrantz and guildenstern .
i ’ ve wanted to see you for a long time now , but i sent for you so hastily because i need your help right away .
you ’ ve probably heard about the “ change ” that ’ s come over hamlet — that ’ s the only word for it , since inside and out he ’ s different from what he was before .
i can ’ t imagine what ’ s made him so unlike himself , other than his father ’ s death .
both you and the king might have ordered us to execute your command , instead of asking us so politely .
but we ’ ll obey .
thanks , rosencrantz and worthy guildenstern .
thanks , guildenstern and worthy rosencrantz .
i beg you to pay a visit right away to my son , who ’ s changed too much .
servants , take these gentlemen to see hamlet .
i hope to god we can make him happy and do him some good !
amen to that !
the ambassadors are back from norway , sir .
once again you bring good news .
do i , sir ?
i assure your majesty i ’ m only doing my duty both to my god and my good king .
it looks like you ’ ve offended it .
look , it ’ s going away .
stay !
i order you , speak !
what ’ s going on , horatio ?
you ’ re pale and trembling .
you agree now that we ’ re not imagining this , don ’ t you ?
what do you think about it ?
i swear to god , if i hadn ’ t seen this with my own eyes i ’ d never believe it .
doesn ’ t it look like the king ?
yes , as much as you look like yourself .
the king was wearing exactly this armor when he fought the king of norway .
and the ghost frowned just like the king did once when he attacked the poles , traveling on the ice in sleds .
it ’ s weird .
and i believe — unless this brain of mine is not so politically cunning as it used to be — that i ’ ve found out why hamlet ’ s gone crazy .
tell me !
i want very much to find out .
all right , but first let the ambassadors speak .
then you can hear my news , as dessert .
then be so kind as to show them in .
gertrude , he says he ’ s found out the reason for your son ’ s insanity .
i doubt it ’ s anything but the obvious reason : his father ’ s dying and our quick marriage .
welcome , my good friends .
tell me , voltemand , what ’ s the news from the king of norway ?
fortinbras swore never to threaten denmark again .
meanwhile , thank you for your efforts .
go relax now .
tonight we ’ ll have dinner .
welcome back !
well , that turned out well in the end .
sir and madam , to make grand speeches about what majesty is , what service is , or why day is day , night is night , and time is time is just a waste of a lot of day , night , and time .
your son is crazy .
crazy ” i ’ m calling it , since how can you say what craziness is except to say that it ’ s craziness ?
but that ’ s another story .
think about it .
i have a daughter ( i have her until she gets married ) who ’ s given me this letter , considering it her duty .
madam , please be patient .
i ’ ll read it to you .
oh , ophelia , i ’ m bad at poetry .
i can ’ t put my feelings into verse , but please believe i love you best , oh , best of all .
believe it .
hamlet . ” dutifully and obediently my daughter showed me this letter , and more like it .
and how did she react to all this ?
sir , what is your opinion of me ?
i know you are loyal and honorable .
i would like to prove to you that i am .
no , i had to do something .
and so i said to my daughter : “ lord hamlet is a prince , he ’ s out of your league .
it may be , it certainly may be .
has there ever been a time — i ’ d really like to know — when i ’ ve definitely said something was true , and it turned out not to be true ?
not that i know of .
what can we do to find out if it ’ s true ?
well , you know he sometimes walks here in the lobby for four hours at a time .
yes , he does .
when he ’ s there next time , i ’ ll send my daughter to see him .
please go away , both of you .
i ’ ll speak to him now .
oh , please let me .
how are you , hamlet ?
fine , thank you .
do you know who i am ?
the town is besieged , and the trumpet calls us to the gap , and we talk and do nothing , by christ .
it ’ s a disgrace to us all .
i swear by the mass , before i close my eyes to go to sleep , i ’ ll put in some good fighting , or i ’ ll lie in the ground dead .
captain macmorris , i think , see — correct me if i ’ m wrong — there are not many of your nation — my nation ?
what is my nation ?
it ’ s a villain and a bastard and a coward and a rascal .
what is my nation ?
who talks of my nation ?
i do not know that you are as good a man as myself .
so , by christ , i ’ ll cut off your head .
now , now , both of you gentlemen !
yes , and that ’ s a serious failing .
the town is asking for a pause in the fighting for negotiation .
captain macmorris , when we have more leisure , see , i will be so bold as to show you i know about the practice of warfare , and that ’ s that .
what has the governor of the town decided ?
this is the final discussion i will grant .
so submit to my mercy or , like men who revel in their own destruction , challenge me to do my worst .
for , as i am a soldier , the name i think suits me best , once i begin my attack on harfleur again , i will not leave the half-conquered town until she lies buried in her own ashes .
the gates of mercy will be closed by then , and harsh and hard-hearted soldiers , who have tasted blood , will have free reign to commit whatever violence they want , mowing down your lovely young virgins and budding infants .
what power can rein in promiscuous evil once it ’ s gotten rolling ?
we might as well send orders to the whale to come ashore as try to restore order in soldiers carried away with their looting .
what do you say ?
will you surrender and avoid all this or be called to account for the destruction of this town ?
today our hopes are at an end .
the dauphin , whom we asked for reinforcements , sends back the answer that he ’ s not yet in a position to raise so great an army .
therefore , great king , we surrender our town and lives to your kind mercy .
open your gates .
come , uncle exeter , enter harfleur .
stay there and fortify it well against the french .
tonight in harfleur we will be your guest ; tomorrow we ’ ll march on .
no , i ’ ll recite it for you right now : “ de hand , de fangres , de nails — ” “ de nails , ” madame .
ugh !
that ’ s enough for one lesson .
he ’ s certainly crossed the river somme .
and if he advances unopposed , my lord , let us abandon france .
let us leave everything and give our vineyards to the barbarous nation .
god alive !
if they march along unopposed , i will sell my dukedom for a sodden , filthy farm in that craggy isle of albion .
doesn ’ t the sun shine palely down on them , as though in contempt , killing their fruit with frowns ?
and shall our lively blood , quickened by wine , be so frosty ?
where is montjoy , the herald ?
send him on his way quickly .
tell him to greet the king of england with our sharp defiance .
stop harry of england , who is now sweeping through our land with banners drenched in the french blood he spilled at harfleur .
have montjoy hurry , then , lord constable , and have him ask the king of england what he is willing to pay us to get out of the war .
prince dauphin , you ’ ll stay with me in rouen .
no , please , i beg your majesty .
be patient , because you ’ re staying with me .
go now , lord constable and all you princes , and quickly bring us news of england ’ s defeat .
is the duke of exeter safe ?
he is called ensign pistol .
i don ’ t know him .
here he is .
captain , i have a favor to beg of you .
you ’ re on very good terms with the duke of exeter .
yes , god be praised , i have managed to earn his favor .
she provides an excellent moral .
i ’ m glad to hear it .
discipline must be kept .
then die and be damned !
why , that man is a total fraud and rascal .
what he just said to me — it ’ s alright .
and what a beard trimmed like the general ’ s or a rough uniform will do among foaming mugs and brains washed with ale , you wouldn ’ t believe .
but you must learn to recognize such liars , or you will be greatly taken advantage of .
if i find an opportunity , i will give him a piece of my mind .
tell me , fluellen : did you just come from the bridge ?
yes , your majesty .
the duke of exeter has held the bridge very gallantly .
the french have retreated , see , and there were great acts of courage .
indeed , the enemy nearly took the bridge , but he was forced to retreat , and the duke of exeter holds the bridge .
i can tell your majesty , the duke is a brave man .
what men have you lost , fluellen ?
the enemy ’ s losses have been very great , pretty substantial .
to tell the truth , though , i think the duke hasn ’ t lost a single man , except for one who will probably be executed for robbing a church , one bardolph — i don ’ t know if your majesty knows the man .
you know from my clothing who i am .
well then , i know who you are .
what do you have to tell me ?
my master ’ s decision .
go ahead .
my king says this : “ tell harry of england : though we appeared dead , we were only asleep .
strategy makes a better soldier than haste .
tell him we could have driven him back at harfleur but thought it unwise to burst a pustule before it had fully ripened .
now the time is right for us to speak , and we do so with imperial authority .
what kept you from telling him this ?
the french ambassador arrived at that moment and asked to see the king .
and , in fact , i think they ’ re meeting together right now .
is it four o 'clock ?
it is .
then let ’ s go in and hear what he has to say — though i think i can guess before the frenchman has uttered a word .
have lost , and the indignity we have endured , for which he is too insignificant to sufficiently pay us back .
his coffers are too poor to atone for our losses , his entire kingdom too small to account for the amount of blood we ’ ve shed , and the sight of him kneeling at our feet an empty satisfaction compared to the indignity we have put up with .
add defiance to all this and , by way of conclusion , tell him that he has betrayed the men who follow him , whose death sentence has been pronounced . ” my king and master ’ s message delivered , my task is done .
what is your name ?
i know your position .
montjoy .
you do your job well .
but god forgive me for bragging .
anyway , go tell your master i am here .
i ’ ll deliver the message .
i thank your highness .
i hope they don ’ t attack us now .
we ’ re in god ’ s hands , brother , not in theirs .
march to the bridge .
night is approaching .
i have the best armor in the world .
i wish it were day !
you have wonderful armor , but give my horse his due .
it is the best horse in europe .
will it never be morning ?
my lord of orléans , and my lord high constable , are you talking about horses and armor ?
you are as well provided in both respects as any prince in the world .
what a long night this is !
i will not trade my horse for any that walks on four legs .
he leaps from the ground as if his insides were light as hairs .
the earth sings when he touches it .
the lowest part of his hoof is more musical than pan ’ s pipe .
he ’ s the color of nutmeg .
and hot as ginger .
he is an animal worthy of perseus .
he is indeed worthy of the name “ horse , ” and you can call all the rest beasts .
indeed , my lord , he is a perfectly wonderful horse .
he is the prince of horses .
his neigh is like a monarch ’ s command .
enough , cousin .
no , the man who cannot extol the virtues of my horse from dawn to dusk is not particularly clever .
it ’ s a subject as worthy of endless discussion as the changing sea .
if each grain of sand had a tongue to eulogize , my horse would be a topic for them all .
he is a subject for a king to contemplate , and for a king ’ s king to ride on , and for the world at large — both friend and stranger — to stop whatever they are doing and marvel at .
i once wrote a sonnet in his praise which began , “ wonder of nature — ” i have heard a sonnet to one ’ s mistress that began like that .
then the writer imitated the one i composed to my steed , for my horse is my mistress .
your mistress is a good mount .
so , perhaps , did yours .
mine wasn ’ t wearing a bridle .
oh , then i guess she was old and gentle , and you rode barelegged , like an irish yokel .
you ’ re a good judge of horsemanship .
take a tip from me , then .
i ’ d rather have my horse than a mistress .
i ’ d prefer to keep my mistress rather than some lame horse .
i ’ ll tell you this , constable , my mistress has his own hair .
i could make the same boast even if i had a pig as my mistress .
the dog returns to its own vomit , and the newly washed sow to its mud puddle . ” you ’ d take anything for a mistress .
at least i don ’ t have a horse for my mistress — or a saying so beside the point .
my lord constable , are those stars or suns i saw on the armor in your tent tonight ?
stars , my lord .
i hope some will fall off tomorrow .
and yet i ’ ll still have plenty .
no doubt , for you wear too many in the first place , and it might be more seemly to make do with fewer .
yes , like your horse , who , staggering under your boasts , would trot more easily if some of them dismounted .
i only wish i could load him up with all the praise he deserves !
oh , will it never be day ?
i ’ d say the same thing , but i ’ m afraid i ’ d be faced out of my way .
it ’ s midnight .
i ’ ll go put my armor on .
the dauphin really wants it to be morning .
he wants to eat the english .
swear by her foot , so she can stamp out the oath .
he ’ s definitely the most active gentleman of france .
performing is activity , and he is always doing that .
he never did harm that i heard of .
and he ’ s not going to do any tomorrow .
that part of his reputation will stand .
i know him to be valiant .
i was told that by one who knows him better than you .
who was that ?
why , he told me so himself , and he said he didn ’ t care who knew it .
he doesn ’ t have to care .
his virtue is not hidden .
his courage is hidden , and when it is revealed , it will shrink .
ill will never prompted anything well said .
i ’ ll go straight for that proverb with “ to hell with the devil . ” you are better at proverbs than i am by as much as “ a fool shoots quickly and overshoots his mark . ” you have overshot .
i ’ ve outshot you , and not for the first time .
my lord high constable , the english lie within fifteen hundred paces of your tents .
who measured the ground ?
the lord grandpré .
poor harry of england !
he doesn ’ t long for the dawn as we do .
what a miserable and obstinate fellow this king of england is , to blunder with his fat-headed followers so far beyond his capacity .
if the english had any sense , they would run away .
if there were anything inside their heads , they could never wear such heavy helmets .
that island of england breeds very valiant creatures .
their hounds are unequaled in courage .
foolish dogs , blindly running straight toward a russian bear only to have their heads crushed like rotten apples .
you might just as well say , “ that ’ s a valiant flea that dares to eat its breakfast on the lip of a lion . ” yes , exactly .
and the men resemble their english hounds in their loud , showy ferocity , too , leaving their brains behind with their wives .
give them hefty meals of beef and iron and steel , and they will eat like wolves and fight like devils .
yes , but these english are seriously short of beef .
then tomorrow we ’ ll find that they feel only like eating , not like fighting .
it ’ s time to put our armor on .
shall we get started ?
it ’ s two o 'clock now .
but let me see , by ten we shall each have captured a hundred englishmen .
now summon up the image of stealthy murmurs and engulfing darkness filling the wide vessel of the universe .
he bids them good morning with a modest smile and calls
where is my gracious lord of canterbury ?
he ’ s not here .
send for him , dear uncle .
shall we call in the ambassador , my liege ?
not yet , cousin .
before i hear him , i want to decide some important issues that are on my mind concerning my throne and france .
may god and his angels guard your sacred throne and grant that you dignify it for a long time .
thank you , i ’ m sure .
my learned lord , kindly explain to us the legal and religious grounds for why this french salic law either should or shouldn ’ t bar me in my claim .
them brothers , friends , and countrymen .
gloucester , it ’ s true that we are in great danger .
but our courage should only be the greater for that .
good morning , brother bedford .
god almighty , there must be some essential goodness even in evil , if men would only look for it .
in our case , our bad neighbors over their make us early risers , a healthy and sensible thing to be .
besides , they act as outward consciences and preachers to us all , a visible reminder that we should prepare ourselves for death .
think like that , and you ’ ll manage to get honey out of a common weed and find a moral lesson in the devil himself .
good morning , old sir thomas erpingham !
a nice , soft pillow would be a more suitable place to lay that good white head than france ’ s hard , cold ground .
it eases the spirit .
and when the mind is engaged , the rest of the body , dead and dull before , wakes up and comes to life with a new nimbleness and sensitivity , like a snake shedding its dead skin .
lend me your cloak , sir thomas .
we shall , my liege .
shall i accompany your grace ?
no , my good knight .
go with my brothers to my english peers .
i need to be alone with my thoughts for a while and don ’ t want any company .
the lord in heaven bless you , noble harry !
a friend .
or are you low , vulgar , and of the common people ?
i am a gentleman of a company .
do you carry a pike ?
exactly .
what about you ?
i ’ m as good a gentleman as the emperor .
then you ’ re a better man than the king .
the king ’ s a dear boy with a heart of gold , he ’ s a lively lad , a wag , born of fine parents , good with his fists .
i kiss his dirty shoe , and from the bottom of my heart i love the lovely boy .
what is your name ?
harry le roy .
le roy ?
that ’ s a cornish name .
are you with a cornish company ?
no , i am a welshman .
do you know fluellen ?
yes .
tell him i ’ ll take the leek out of his hat on saint davy ’ s day and slap his head with it .
you ’ d better not wear your dagger in your cap that day , or he might slap your head with it .
are you his friend ?
yes , and his relative , too .
thank you .
god be with you .
my name is pistol .
the name suits your fierceness .
captain fluellen !
it never ceases to amaze me the way people ignore the correct , traditional principles and rules of war .
if you would take the trouble to study the tactics of pompey the great , i can tell you that you would find no tittle-tattle or pibble-pabble in pompey ’ s camp .
i tell you , you would find the rituals of war and , i promise you , its ceremonies and its solicitudes and its forms and its gravity and its discipline all to be quite counter to all this noise .
but the enemy is loud .
you can hear them all night long .
and if the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating idiot , does that mean , you think , that we should also be an ass and a fool and a prating idiot ?
think about it .
i will lower my voice .
though he seems a little old-fashioned , there is much care and courage in this welshman .
brother john bates , isn ’ t that dawn breaking over there ?
that ’ s the beginning of the day we see , but i don ’ t think we ’ ll see the end of it . — who goes there ?
a friend .
what captain do you serve ?
sir thomas erpingham .
a veteran commander and a very kind gentleman .
tell me , what does he think of our situation ?
we ’ re men beached on the sand , hoping to be washed out by the next tide .
he hasn ’ t told this to the king , has he ?
the violet smells to him the same as it does to me .
and though his feelings may be pitched higher than ours , when they plummet , they plummet that much farther .
therefore , when he has reason to fear , as we do , his fears are without question of the same order .
still , it stands to reason that he mustn ’ t betray his fear , as it might dishearten his army .
i ’ ll tell you truly what i think about the king in my heart .
i don ’ t think he wants to be anywhere but where he is .
oh , i ’ m sure you don ’ t dislike him so much as to wish he were here alone , even though you say this to find out how the rest of us feel .
i don ’ t think there ’ s anywhere i ’ d rather die than in the king ’ s company , as his cause is just and honorable .
that ’ s more than we know .
if his cause is wrong , our obedience to the king clears us of responsibility for it .
i think few die well who die in battle .
the father and the master and the king didn ’ t order their subordinates ' deaths when they ordered their services .
besides , there ’ s no king , however pure his cause , who , if it comes to a trial by combat , can rely on using completely blameless soldiers .
even if these men have escaped the law and punishment at home , they cannot escape god .
when they feared death , they escaped with their lives ; and now where they imagine they ’ re safe , they perish .
so , if they die unprepared , the king is no more guilty of their damnation than he was guilty of the earlier crimes they ’ re finally being punished for .
every subject ’ s duty is the king ’ s , but every subject ’ s soul is his own .
therefore , every soldier should do as any man who is sick in his bed would do : clear his conscience of any stain .
then if he dies , his death serves him .
it ’ s clear , every man must take responsibility for the manner of his own death .
the king is not responsible for it .
i don ’ t expect him to answer for me , and yet i ’ m determined to fight vigorously for him .
i myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed .
if i live to see it , i ’ ll never trust his word again .
yeah , right , go get him .
that ’ s a lame threat from a toy gun , a poor individual ’ s private displeasure with a monarch .
you may as well try to turn the sun to ice by fanning its face with a peacock feather .
you ’ ll “ never trust his word again . ” come on , that was a stupid thing to say .
your scolding is somewhat overblown .
i ’ d be angry with you if the occasion allowed .
let it be a quarrel between us , if you live .
i ’ m game .
how will i recognize you in the future ?
give me some trinket of yours , and i will wear it in my hat .
then , if you dare to acknowledge it , i ’ ll take up my quarrel with you .
here .
i ’ ll also wear this in my cap .
if you come to me after tomorrow and say , “ that ’ s my glove , ” i swear by this hand , i will take it and give you a box on the ear .
if i ever see it , i will challenge you .
you may as well undertake to be hanged .
i ’ ll do it even if i find you in the company of the king himself .
keep your word .
farewell .
indeed , the french can bet twenty french crowns to one that they ’ ll beat us , they have such an army .
but it ’ s no treason for an englishman to cut off a french crown — a head , i mean — and tomorrow the king himself will do some snipping .
to wage war .
i charge you , in the name of god , be careful what you say .
with this in mind , speak , my lord .
then hear me , gracious sovereign , and all you peers who owe your lives and duty to this imperial throne .
upon the king !
let ’ s lay everything upon the king : our lives , our souls , our debts , our anxious wives , our children , and our sins . ” i must bear responsibility for all of it .
what a painful condition responsibility is .
it goes along with being born to greatness , but it makes you get badmouthed by every fool who only has his own suffering to care about .
what infinite peace do king ’ s give up that private men enjoy ?
what do kings have that private men do not , besides the pomp of their position ?
and what is this useless ceremony of kings ?
what kind of god is ceremony , which suffers more than its worshippers do ?
what income , what profit does it bring in ?
oh , ceremony , only show me your value !
why are you adored ?
you ’ re less happy , being feared , than they are in fearing you .
what do you get to drink , instead of sweet obedience , but poisonous flattery ?
try being sick , great greatness , and see if ceremony can cure you !
do you think fiery fever can be put out by the windy puff of titles ?
will it be chased away by bowing and scraping ?
you can command a beggar to bow on bended knee , but can you take possession of his health ?
no , vain illusion , so intricately bound up with a king ’ s rest .
dusk and all night long sleeps in peace .
my lord , your noble subjects are looking for you all over the camp .
good old knight , gather them all together at my tent .
i ’ ll meet you there .
consider it done , my lord .
oh god of battles , bolster my soldiers ' courage .
don ’ t let them know fear .
rob them of the ability to count before the numbers against them overwhelm their courage .
and just for today , oh , lord , just today don ’ t think of the crime my father committed in seizing the crown !
i ’ ve transferred richard ’ s body to a new grave and on it poured more tears of remorse than it has shed drops of blood .
i ’ ve hired five hundred almsmen to hold up their withered hands to heaven , praying for my pardon twice a day throughout the year .
and i ’ ve built two chapels where solemn priests sing continually for richard ’ s soul .
i will do more , though nothing i can do is any good since this remorse comes after the crime , asking for pardon .
my liege .
my brother gloucester ’ s voice ?
i ’ ll go with you .
the day , my friends , and everything await me .
the sun glints off our armor .
awake , my lords !
is it time , my lord constable ?
listen to our horses neighing , longing to be working .
ha !
what , you want them to weep our horses ' blood ?
then how will we see their own natural tears ?
the english are in the field , french lords .
to our horses , you gallant princes .
what ’ s there to say ?
our advance will so dazzle the enemy that england will cower in fear and surrender .
what are you waiting for , lords of france ?
those island-bred skeletons , terrified for their bones , are an offensive sight on the morning field .
the horsemen stand frozen like candlesticks , torches in their hands .
meanwhile , their they ’ ve said their prayers , and now they wait for death .
shall we go send them food and fresh clothing and feed their starving horses before we fight them ?
to the field !
i ’ ll take the banner from a trumpeter and use that .
come , let ’ s be off !
the sun is up and we ’ re wasting the day !
where is the king ?
the king rode out alone to view their troops .
they have fully sixty thousand fighting men .
that ’ s five to one .
besides , they ’ re fresh .
may god ’ s arm strike on our side !
these are frightening odds .
god be with all of you , princes .
i ’ ll go and join my men .
farewell , good salisbury ; and may good luck go with you .
farewell , kind lord .
fight valiantly today .
but then i do you wrong to say as much , since you are the very embodiment of bravery .
he is as full of courage as of kindness , princely in both .
oh , if only we had with us here ten thousand of those men back home in england who aren ’ t working today .
who wishes that ?
my cousin westmoreland ?
no , my dear cousin .
if we are slated to die , the fewer , the better for our country , and if we ’ re slated to live , the fewer men , the greater the share of honor for each of us .
in god ’ s name , i beg you not to wish for one more man .
by god , i am not selfish when it comes to money : i don ’ t care who eats at my expense .
but if it is a sin to be selfish about honor , i am the most guilty soul alive .
no , my cousin , don ’ t wish that even one man who is now in england were here instead .
by god , i wouldn ’ t lose as much honor as a single man more would cost me , i think — not even if it meant giving up my best hope for victory .
oh , do not wish one more !
he will be given safe conduct and money for his passage home .
we would not want to die in the company of a man who fears to die with us .
we ’ re ready if our minds are ready .
let any man perish who isn ’ t ready now !
you don ’ t wish we had more help from england anymore , cousin ?
god be with you all .
once more i come to ask you , king harry , if you ’ re ready to negotiate your ransom before your certain defeat .
for assuredly , you are so near the abyss that you ’ re bound to be swallowed up .
moreover , out of mercy , the constable urges you to remind your men to make their peace with god and repent , so that their souls may depart sweetly and peacefully from these fields where , poor wretches , their bodies will likely fall and fester .
who sent you this time ?
the constable of france .
be good enough to take back the same answer i gave before .
tell them to capture me , then sell my bones .
the man that once sold the skin of a lion while the beast still lived died hunting him .
and on their graves , i trust , the story of this day ’ s work will be written in brass .
and those who leave their valiant bones in france , dying like men though buried in your dunghills — they ’ ll be remembered , too .
besides , according to the french historians , king pepin , who deposed childeric , based his own claim to the crown of france on his descent from blithild , the daughter of king clothair .
thus , it should be clear as day that king pepin ’ s title , hugh capet ’ s claim , and the resolution of king lewis ’ s doubts all plainly derive from the female .
let me speak proudly : tell the constable we ’ re only workaday soldiers .
there ’ s not a strand of feather left in our whole army — a good sign , i hope , that we won ’ t fly away like birds — and time on the field has made us slovenly .
if they do this , as they will , god willing , my ransom will soon be raised .
herald , spare yourself .
don ’ t come again to ask for my ransom , good messenger .
i swear the only ransom will be these bones of mine .
tell the constable that .
i shall , king harry .
and so farewell .
you ’ ll never hear from the herald again .
i ’ m afraid you ’ ll come to me again for ransom .
my lord , most humbly on bended knee i beg you to grant me the leading of the vanguard .
take it , brave york .
now , soldiers , advance .
surrender , dog !
is that a lot of he says his name is master fer .
master fer !
what does he say ?
he begs you to spare his life .
he is a gentleman of a good family , and for his ransom , he will give you two hundred crowns .
tell him my fury will abate , and i ’ ll take the crowns .
explain , boy .
he thanks you on his knees many times and considers himself fortunate to have fallen into the hands of one , as he thinks , who is the bravest , most valorous , and thrice-worthy gentleman of england .
as i get to leech him , i will show some mercy .
follow me .
i never heard so loud a voice issue from such an empty heart .
i have to stay with the servants , who are with our camp ’ s luggage .
we ’ re sitting ducks for the french , if they only knew it , for there is no one guarding it but boys .
regret and everlasting shame sit on our helmets , mocking us .
do not run away .
our men have all broken ranks .
o , everlasting shame !
let ’ s fall on our swords .
are these the wretches that we threw dice for ?
is this the king we offered to ransom ?
shame , eternal shame , and nothing but shame !
let us die honorably .
he who will not follow me now , let him depart and stand in the doorway like a pimp , cap in hand , while some slave , no nobler than my dog , violates his daughter .
maybe we can benefit from the same chaos that has defeated us .
let ’ s go offer up our lives
there are enough of us still alive in the field to overcome the english with our numbers if we could just restore some kind of order .
the hell with order !
i ’ m going back into battle .
let life be short so that shame won ’ t last too long .
the french are still fighting .
the duke of york sends your majesty his respects .
is he still alive , good uncle ?
three times in an hour i saw him down , and three times up again and fighting .
he was covered with blood from his helmet to his spurs .
by his side lies the noble earl of suffolk , york ’ s comrade and equal in brave wounds .
suffolk died first , and york , cut to pieces , came to him where he lay in his blood and took him by the face , kissing his gashes .
he cried out , “ wait for me , dear cousin .
my soul will keep yours company on the way to heaven .
wait for mine , sweet soul .
the french have reinforced their scattered men .
then every soldier must kill his prisoners .
spread the word .
to this day , the kings of france follow this unspoken rule , even though they point to this salic law to bar your highness from inheriting it through the female line .
can i justifiably and in good conscience make this claim ?
go to the tomb of your great-grandfather , from whom your own title to the crown derives .
o noble english , who could take on the entire french army with only half their forces , leaving the other half to stand by , idle and laughing .
awaken the memory of those valiant ancestors and with your own powerful arm make their deeds live again .
you are their heir and sit on their throne , and the blood and courage that glorified them run in your veins .
to kill the boys with the luggage !
it ’ s expressly against the rules of combat .
it ’ s as complete a work of villainy as any that could be thought up .
there ’ s certainly not a boy left alive , and it was done by the cowardly rascals who were running from the battle .
on top of this , they ’ ve either burned or carried away everything that was in the king ’ s tent .
oh , he ’ s a gallant king !
yes , he was born at monmouth , captain gower .
and is “ pig ” not the same as “ great , ” may i ask ?
the pig or the mighty or the huge or the magnanimous — they all mean the same thing , with some variation .
i think alexander the great was born in macedon .
his father was philip of macedon , as i remember .
i think that macedon is indeed where alexander was born .
i tell you , captain , if you look at a map of the world , i ’ ll bet you will find , comparing macedon and monmouth , that the situations , see , are very similar .
there is a river in macedon , and there is likewise a river in monmouth .
the river in monmouth is called wye , but the name of the other river has gone out of my head .
nevertheless , it ’ s all one — the two rivers are as alike as my fingers are to my fingers , and there are salmon in both .
if you look closely at alexander ’ s life , harry of monmouth ’ s stands up fairly well by comparison — for there are analogies in everything .
it is not courteous , you know , to assume you know my meaning before i ’ ve finished talking .
i ’ m speaking purely in analogies and comparisons .
sir john falstaff .
that ’ s the one .
i tell you , there are good men born at monmouth .
here comes his majesty .
i was not angry since i came to france until this instant .
take a trumpet , herald .
ride out to the horsemen on that hill .
if they seek battle with us , have them come down or else clear the field .
the sight of them is offensive .
if they ’ ll do neither , we ’ ll come to them and make them fly like stones shot from powerful slings .
go and tell them this .
here comes the herald of the french , my liege .
he looks humbler than he used to .
don ’ t you know that i have offered these bones of mine for ransom ?
are you coming again for ransom ?
no , great king .
likewise , our common men lie drenched in the blood of princes , and their wounded steeds , ankle-deep in gore , struggle and , raging wildly , stamp on their dead masters with their hooves , killing them a second time .
oh , give us permission , great king , to search the field in safety and dispose of our dead bodies .
you won it .
god , not our strength , be praised !
what is the name of the castle that stands over there ?
agincourt .
then we ’ ll call this the battle of agincourt , fought on the day of crispin crispianus .
if i may say so , your majesty , your famous grandfather and your great-uncle edward , the black prince of wales — or so i ’ ve read in the history books — fought a very brave battle here in france .
they did , fluellen .
your majesty is quite right .
if your majesties recall it , the welsh fought very valiantly in a garden where there were leeks growing , wearing leeks in their monmouth caps which , your majesty knows , is to this day a badge of honorable military service .
i do believe your majesty takes no shame in wearing the leek on saint davy ’ s day .
i wear it with pride , for i am welsh you know , good countryman .
thanks , my good countryman .
by jesus , i am your majesty ’ s countryman , and i don ’ t care who knows it .
i will confess it to all the world .
i needn ’ t be ashamed of your majesty , god be praised , so long as your majesty is an honest man .
god keep me so . — heralds , go with him .
bring me an exact report of the number of dead on both sides .
soldier , you must come to the king .
soldier , why are you wearing that glove in your cap ?
if it pleases your majesty , it is the token of a man i must fight with , if he ’ s still alive .
an englishman ?
if i may say so , your majesty , as i see it he would be a coward and a villain not to .
it may be that his antagonist is a gentleman of very high degree , quite outside of his own sphere .
even if he were as important a man as the devil — as lucifer or beelzebub himself — he ’ s required , see , your grace , to keep his vow .
if he backs down , he ’ ll become as notorious a villain and as saucy a jack as ever walked on god ’ s earth , in my opinion .
then keep your vow , fellow , when you meet the man .
so i will , my liege .
whom do you serve under ?
under captain gower , my liege .
gower is a good captain , and is well versed and well read in the wars .
have him come to me here , soldier .
i will , my liege .
here , fluellen , stick this in your cap .
your grace does me as great an honor as could be wished by any of his subjects .
do you know captain gower ?
he is my dear friend , your majesty .
go find him , please , and bring him to my tent .
i ’ ll fetch him .
my lord of warwick and my brother gloucester , follow fluellen at a close distance .
the glove which i have given him to wear may possibly win him a box on the ear .
according to an agreement , i should wear it myself .
follow and see to it that nothing serious happens between them .
you come with me , uncle of exeter .
i ’ m sure it is to knight you , captain .
as it is god ’ s will and pleasure , captain , i entreat you to come quickly to the king .
sir , do you recognize this glove ?
know the glove !
i know the glove is a glove .
well , i recognize this one good god !
as absolute a traitor as any in the whole entire world — or even france or england !
do you think i ’ d break my oath ?
stand aside , captain gower .
i ’ ll reward treason with blows , i promise you .
i ’ m not a traitor .
arrest him : he ’ s a friend of the duke of alençon ’ s .
my lord of warwick , a most corrupt treason — god be praised for it ! — has been discovered , as plain as any you ’ d hope to see on a summer ’ s day .
here is his majesty .
my liege , this man is a villain and a traitor , who — see , your grace — has struck the glove which your majesty took from alençon ’ s helmet .
my liege , this was my glove .
i met this man with my glove in his cap , and i have been as good as my word .
your majesty , see here — if it won ’ t offend your grace — what a complete , rascally , beggarly , lousy rat this is .
i hope your majesty will , in all good conscience , bear me out and vouch for the fact that this is the glove of alençon and that your majesty gave it to me .
it was i , in fact , whom you promised to strike .
and so you do .
their bodies may remain here in england , but their hearts are encamped on the fields of france already .
what we have to worry about is a full-scale invasion from scotland — always an unreliable neighbor .
if it pleases your majesty , let his neck pay the price , if there is any martial law in the world .
how can you square things with me ?
you abused me to my face .
your majesty didn ’ t present yourself as the king .
you represented yourself as just a common man .
anything your highness suffered in that disguise , i beg you to see it as your own fault and not mine , because if you ’ d been what i took you for , there would have been no offense .
therefore , i beg your highness , pardon me .
i ’ ll have none of your money .
it ’ s meant in good will .
i tell you , you can use it to get your shoes fixed .
come , why be so hesitant ?
your shoes are in pretty bad shape .
it ’ s a good shilling , i promise you .
now , herald , have the dead been counted ?
here is the count of the slaughtered french .
what prisoners of rank have been taken , uncle ?
this paper tells me of ten thousand frenchmen who lie dead on the battlefield .
among them are one hundred twenty-six princes and standard-bearing nobles .
add to these eight thousand four hundred knights , squires , and brave gentlemen , five hundred of whom were given the title of knight only yesterday .
among the ten thousand the french have lost only sixteen hundred are mercenaries .
the rest of the dead are princes , barons , lords , knights , squires , and gentlemen of birth and rank .
of brave earls , grandpré and roussi , fauconberg and foix , beaumont and marle , vaudemont and lestrale .
where is the number of our english dead ?
when was there ever before so great a loss on one side and so little on the other , in the ordinary and equal clash of battle ?
take credit , god , for it is no one ’ s doing but yours .
it ’ s unbelievable .
yes , captain , but with this acknowledgement — that god fought for us .
yes , i truly think he did great good .
we ’ ll perform all the holy rites .
let ’ s have him land and solemnly proceed to london .
thoughts work so quickly that even now you can imagine him on blackheath , where his lords suggest that he should carry his battle-scarred sword and helmet on a procession through the city .
he refuses , as he is free of vanity and self-serving pride and ascribes all the glory and responsibility for victory to god .
now in the factory of thought , create the image of all london pouring forth into the streets .
picture the mayor and all his brother citizens dressed in their best as they go forth like senators of ancient rome to welcome home their conquering caesar .
skip over all the particularities between then and harry ’ s return to france .
saint davy ’ s day has passed .
there are reasons and causes why and how in everything .
we were somewhere where i couldn ’ t pick a fight with him , but i ’ ve decided to wear it in my cap until i see him again , whereupon i ’ ll give him a little piece of my mind .
and here he comes , puffing himself up like a turkey .
are you mad ?
away !
the smell of leek turns my stomach .
i wonder if you ’ d be so good , you lousy , rotten villain , to grant my wish and my request and gratify me , see , by eating this leek .
i ’ d like you to , see , because you don ’ t like it , and because it isn ’ t to your taste , and because it doesn ’ t agree with you .
not for cadwallader and all his goats .
here ’ s a goat for you .
dissolute lowlife , you shall die .
that ’ s very true , mangy rascal , when it pleases god .
meanwhile , i ’ d be gratified if you ’ d live and eat your food .
come , here ’ s some sauce to go with it .
enough , captain .
you ’ ve stunned him .
i tell you , i ’ ll either make him eat some part of this leek or give him a four-day head-bashing . — go on , bite .
it ’ s good for your fresh wound and your bloody noggin .
must i bite ?
yes , absolutely , no question or ambiguity about it .
by this leek , i swear i ’ ll make you pay for this .
would you like some more sauce to go with it ?
there isn ’ t enough leek left for you to swear on .
lay off , already !
can ’ t you see i ’ m eating ?
i sincerely hope it does you good , mangy rascal .
no , don ’ t throw any of it away .
the skin is good for your cracked head .
when you see leeks in the future , i hope you keep mocking them .
good .
yes , leeks are good .
wait , here ’ s a penny to heal your head .
me , a penny ?
if i owe you anything , i ’ ll pay you in clubbings .
you ’ ll become a wood salesman and buy nothing but clubs from me .
god be with you and keep you , and may he heal your head .
there ’ ll be hell to pay for this .
go on , get out of here .
you ’ re a lying , cowardly wretch .
you mock an ancient tradition , born of reverence and worn in honor of brave men who have died , and then have the gall not to stand by your words .
i ’ ve seen you bait and mock this man more than once .
you thought because he didn ’ t speak english like a native he couldn ’ t handle an english club .
farewell .
has fortune turned on me , like the whore she is ?
i ’ ve had news that my nell died of the pox in a hospice .
i grow old , and all dignity has been thrashed out of me .
well , i ’ ll turn pimp and do some occasional pickpocketing .
i ’ ll steal away to england , and i ’ ll steal some more when i get there .
i ’ ll bandage up these wounds and swear i got them in the french wars .
it would follow from this that the cat should stay home .
but that is a false conclusion , since we have locks to keep our valuables safe and clever traps to catch little thieves .
while the armed hand fights in foreign lands , the wise head defends itself at home .
we rejoice to see you , most worthy brother of england .
you are welcome here , as are all of you english princes .
we hope your poison has worn off and this day shall transform all grievances and quarrels into friendship .
we ’ re here to say “ amen ” to that .
all you english princes , i salute you .
great kings of france and england , i owe you both equal service and loyalty .
your highnesses can both attest to the fact that i ’ ve strived mightily , with all my wits and energy , to bring about this royal meeting between you two imperial majesties .
alas , she has been too long exiled from france , whose crops all lie in heaps , rotting with ripeness .
her grapes , which make the wine that cheers our hearts , die unpruned on the vines .
her once-trimmed hedges , like prisoners with wild , untended hair , put forth unruly twigs .
her fallow fields are overgrown with weeds , while the blade that should uproot such wilderness lies rusting .
they grow like savages — like soldiers who meditate on nothing but blood — surrounded by swearing and stern looks , ragged clothing and everything unnatural .
the king has heard them , but as yet has made no answer .
well , the peace you pleaded for so eloquently just now lies in his answer .
i ’ ve only given the articles a cursory glance .
if your grace would kindly appoint some members of your council to sit with me once more and go over them more carefully , i will give my answer and acceptance right away .
fair sister , will you go with the princes or stay here with me ?
gracious brother , i will go with them .
perhaps a woman ’ s voice may do some good when some small detail proves to be holding things up .
in that case , leave our cousin katherine here with us .
she is our principal demand — one of the first points of the treaty .
she is welcome to stay .
lovely , most lovely katherine , will you agree to teach a soldier the words that would recommend his love-suit to a gentle heart like yours ?
your majesty shall mock at me .
i cannot speak your england .
lovely katherine , if you will love me well with your french heart , i ’ m happy to hear you confess it in broken english .
do you like me , kate ?
pardon me but i do not know what is “ like me . ” an angel is like you , kate , and you are like an angel .
i said so , dear katherine , and i ’ m not ashamed to repeat it .
kate , my wooing is fit for your understanding : i am glad your english isn ’ t better .
if it were , you would find me such an ordinary king that you would think i ’ d sold my farm to buy my crown .
i don ’ t know any fancy ways of talking about love , only to say right out , “ i love you . ” if you press me any further than with the question , “ do you really ? ” my love scene is over .
so give me your answer , and we ’ ll shake on it .
deal ?
i have no gift for the one and no strength for the other , though i have the gift of strength .
if i could win a lady by playing leapfrog or vaulting into my saddle with my armor on my back — though you may accuse me of boasting — i could easily get myself a wife .
if you can love a man of this temperament , kate , whose face a sunburn wouldn ’ t make any worse and who never looks in the mirror to admire himself , let your eye improve me .
i speak to you as a plain soldier .
if you can love me for this , take me .
if not , to tell you i will die is true , but not for love , by god .
and yet i do love you .
so take for life a fellow of pure and plain faithfulness .
these chatty fellows who can rhyme their way into a lady ’ s good graces always reason themselves out again .
if you would have such a man , take me .
so what do you say to my suit ?
speak , my fair one , and speak fairly , i beg you .
is it possible dat i sould love de enemy of france ?
no , it is not possible you should love the enemy of france , kate .
but in loving me , you would love the friend of france , for i love france so much that i will not part with a single village of it .
i will have it all mine .
and , kate , when france is mine and i am yours , then france is yours and you are mine .
i don ’ t understand all dat .
no , kate ?
can any of your neighbors tell , kate ?
i ’ ll ask them .
but mock me gently , dear kate , because i love you terribly .
shall we not ?
what do you say , my fair i do not know dat .
no , of course you don ’ t .
now there can only be the promise .
do promise , kate , that you ’ ll do your french part to bring forth such a boy ; and for my english half , take the word of a king and a bachelor .
i tell you truly , in true english : i love you , kate .
and though i wouldn ’ t dare to swear that you love me , still my blood begins to flatter me that you do , despite the ill effects of my face .
curse my father ’ s ambition !
but i promise you , kate : the older i grow the better i ’ ll look .
my comfort is that old age , that poor preserver of beauty , can ’ t make my face any worse than it already is .
if you have me , you have me now at my worst ; and if you have me , you ’ ll appreciate me better and better .
therefore tell me , fairest katherine , will you have me ?
come on , tell me in broken music — for your voice is music and your english broken .
come , katherine queen of all , reveal your heart to me in broken english .
will you have me ?
den it shall also content me .
with that i kiss your hand and call you my queen .
then i will kiss your lips , kate .
what does she say , madam interpreter ?
dat it not be de custom pour les ladies of france — i cannot tell vat is to kiss .
it is not the custom for the maids in france to kiss before they are married , is that what she says ?
oh , kate , prudish customs bow before great kings .
you and i cannot be held within the confines of a country ’ s arbitrary customs , dear kate .
you and i , kate , we are the makers of custom , and the freedom that goes with our position silences all who would criticize , as i will silence you for upholding the prudish custom of your country in refusing me a kiss .
therefore , willingly and yielding .
god save your majesty .
my royal kinsman , are you teaching our princess english ?
i wanted to teach her how perfectly i love her , kinsman , and that ’ s good english .
she picks it up quick , doesn ’ t she ?
so , possessing neither a voice nor a heart for flattery , i can ’ t awaken the spirit of love in her so as to make him appear in his true likeness .
forgive my boldness if i take you up on your words about making magic .
for love to appear in his true likeness , he would have to be as cupid is : naked and blind .
how can you blame her , a tender young maiden still given to virgin blushes , for objecting to having a blind , naked boy appear before her ?
it ’ s a lot to ask of a maiden .
they ’ re forgiven , then , if they don ’ t see what they ’ re doing .
then teach your cousin to also be willing to close her eyes , my lord .
so you ’ re telling me to give it time and wait for summer .
and even then , in order for me to catch the fly your cousin , she must be blind ?
like love , my lord , before it learns to love .
fair enough .
shall kate be my wife ?
if you wish .
i am satisfied , as long as the maiden cities you talk of come with her .
that way , the maiden that stood between me and them shall be the means of my achieving my desire .
we have consented to all reasonable terms .
is that true , my lords of england ?
the king has agreed to every point : first his daughter , then everything else , as you strictly proposed .
in that case , i ask that for the sake of friendship and alliance you let that one item stand with the rest , and bestow your daughter on me .
amen .
now , welcome , kate . — and let everyone bear witness that here i kiss her as my sovereign queen .
may god , who is the best matchmaker , join your hearts and realms in one .
god say , “ amen ” !
amen !
let us prepare for our wedding . — on that day , i ’ ll take your oath of loyalty , my lord of burgundy and all my peers , to guarantee my treaty .
then i will swear to kate and you to me , and may our oaths be faithfully kept and prove fortunate .
thus far has our straining author pursued the story with his crude , inadequate writing , keeping important people penned up in this little room while he mangled history ’ s full glory with his uneven telling .
henry the sixth , crowned king of france and england while still in his infancy , succeeded him .
with those plays in mind , we hope you ’ ll receive this one kindly .
if we cannot defend our country with three times such a power left at home , then we deserve to be harassed by an invader and lose our reputation as a powerful and politically savvy nation .
call in the messengers sent from the dauphin .
i ’ m ready now to hear what my good cousin the dauphin has to say — for i hear that the greeting you bear is from him , not the king .
will your majesty grant us permission to freely express the message we ’ ve been asked to convey ?
let your thoughts make up for our imperfections .
divide each man into a thousand , and there you will have an imaginary army .
imagine , when we talk of horses , that you see them planting their proud hooves in the soft earth .
i am no tyrant but a christian king , whose emotions are as tightly controlled as the wretches who languish in our prisons .
therefore tell me the dauphin ’ s mind frankly and without constraint .
you can ’ t party your way into dukedoms there .
and in return for this gift , he wishes you to drop your claim to the dukedoms .
this is the dauphin ’ s message .
what ’ s the treasure , uncle ?
tennis balls , my liege .
i ’ m happy the dauphin has such a good sense of humor .
thank you for his present and your trouble .
once i ’ ve put my rackets to these balls , i ’ ll play a set in france , god willing , that will knock his father ’ s crown right out of the court .
and i understand perfectly his sneering reference to my wilder days .
men tend to be at their most irresponsible when they ’ re away from home .
so go in peace .
and tell the dauphin his joke will look pretty stupid when thousands more weep than ever laughed at it .
that was a humorous message .
i hope to make the sender blush for it .
now , lords , don ’ t let slip any opportunity that might be advantageous for our expedition .
therefore , let every man give some thought to how this noble expedition may be undertaken .
now all the young men of england are inspired and have stored their party clothes in the closet .
shifts , friends , to southampton .
but we won ’ t shift the scene to southampton until henry reappears .
good to see you , corporal nym .
good day , lieutenant bardolph .
tell me , are you and ensign pistol friends again yet ?
for my part , i really don ’ t care .
then we can all three be comrades on our way to france .
how about it , corporal nym ?
that ’ s it .
it ’ s not for me to say .
things are what they are .
men may sleep , and when they do they may have their throats with them , and some people say knives have blades .
there must be some resolution .
well , it ’ s not for me to say .
here comes ensign pistol and his wife .
i swear , i scorn the word .
oh , dear .
pish !
pish to you , you mangy dog , you pointy-eared icelandic mutt .
corporal nym , be a man and put away your sword .
get lost , will you ?
i am not some fiend of hell : you can ’ t get rid of me with spells .
i ’ m in a mood to beat you up pretty good .
if you get nasty with me , pistol , i ’ ll stab you with my sword , in fair play .
your grave is gaping open , and your death is near .
so take your last breath .
listen , listen to what i say : whoever strikes first , i ’ ll run him through with my sword , as sure as i ’ m a soldier .
that ’ s an oath of great power , and our fury must subside .
that ’ s enough .
i swear , he ’ ll be food for the crows soon .
the king has broken his heart .
good husband , come home soon .
come on , can i get you two to make up ?
let rivers flood and fiends howl for food !
are you going to pay the eight shillings i won from you in a bet ?
paying debts is for peasants .
i ’ m going to take it from you now .
we ’ ll see , won ’ t we ?
do your best .
by this sword , i ’ ll kill whichever one of you makes the first thrust .
by this sword , i will .
by this sword ” is an oath , and oaths must be kept .
come on , put it away .
in cash .
well , then , that ’ s how it is .
if you ever had a mother , come in quickly to sir john .
the poor thing , he is so shaken with a fever that it ’ s terrible to see .
sweet men , come to him .
and , as the speaker of any prologue should , i ask you to hear our play courteously and to judge it kindly .
nym , what you say is true .
he has his moods and his ways .
how smooth and cool they seem !
just as if they were perfectly loyal and faithful .
the king has been informed of all their plans , but they have no idea .
now that the wind is favorable , let ’ s board the ship .
my lord of cambridge and my good lord of masham and you , my noble knight , what do you think ?
will our army cut a swath through the fighting force of france , achieving and accomplishing everything i ’ ve assembled them to do ?
no doubt it will , my liege , if each man does his best .
i have no doubt about that , since i know there isn ’ t a man among us who isn ’ t with me wholeheartedly , or a soul left behind who doesn ’ t wish us success and conquest .
there never was a monarch better feared and loved than yourself , your majesty .
i don ’ t think there ’ s a single unhappy subject living under the protection of your government .
true .
those who were bitter enemies of your father in his time have turned their bitterness to sweetness , serving you loyally and wholeheartedly .
yes , i have great cause to be thankful .
uncle of exeter , release the man who was arrested yesterday for railing against me .
that ’ s merciful but a bit careless .
oh , let us be merciful anyway .
and now , let ’ s turn to our business with the french .
who are the new commissioners ?
i am one , my lord .
your highness told me to ask for my commission today .
you told me to do the same , my liege .
and me , too , my royal sovereign .
i confess my crime and throw myself on your highness ’ s mercy .
to which we all appeal .
the mercy that was alive in me a moment ago was smothered and killed by your own advice .
though the truth of your treachery is as plain as black on white , i can scarcely believe it , it ’ s so past understanding .
all other devils who tempt people to treason patch together some motive , put together from shreds
and patches of righteousness .
but the devil that tempted you gave you no reason why you should commit treason other than to win the name of traitor .
why , so did you .
why , so did you .
do they come from good families ?
why , so did you .
do they seem religious ?
why , so did you .
that ’ s how sound a man you appeared .
your fall has left a blot that opens even the best and brightest to suspicion .
this treachery of yours is like the second
richard earl of cambridge , i arrest you for high treason .
henry lord scroop of masham , i arrest you for high treason .
thomas grey , knight , of northumberland , i arrest you for high treason .
i regret my crime more than my death , and i beg your highness to forgive me , while punishing my body with death .
but i thank god that i failed in my scheme , and i rejoice in paying the penalty , as i beg god and you to pardon me .
no faithful subject ever rejoiced more at the discovery of most dangerous treason than i now rejoice that i was thwarted in a damnable undertaking .
pardon my crime , sovereign , but not my person .
may god in his mercy forgive you .
i seek no revenge for myself , but so dearly do i hold the safety of my kingdom , which you sought to destroy , that you must be punished according to her laws .
so go to your deaths , poor miserable wretches , the pain of which may merciful god give you the strength to endure .
i have no doubt that it will be a swift and successful war , since god so graciously exposed this dangerous plot .
i ’ m now sure that every bump in the road has been removed .
let ’ s go forth , dear countrymen .
i ’ ll be no king of england if i ’ m not also king of france .
no , because my manly heart is grieving .
bardolph , be happy . — nym , rouse your bragging spirits . — boy , be brave .
oh , no , he ’ s surely not in hell .
he ’ s in they say he cried out against sherry .
yes , he did .
and women .
no , he did not .
he could never bear carnation .
it was a color he never did like .
he once said the devil would get him because of women .
he did touch on women a bit , but his body was aching with fever and he talked about the whore of babylon .
don ’ t you remember how he saw a flea land on bardolph ’ s nose and said it was a black soul burning in hell ?
well , the shall we get moving ?
the king will already have left southampton .
look after my goods and possessions .
my lord , this bill that ’ s being proposed is the same one that was proposed in the eleventh year of old king henry ’ s reign .
everyone thought it would pass then , and it probably would have had it not been for the great civil unrest and uncertainty of the time , which required the matter to be put off .
but how will we keep it from being passed now , my lord ?
we have to think about that .
that ’ s what the bill says .
but what can be done to prevent it ?
the king is virtuous and kind .
and a true lover of the holy church .
i ’ ve heard that ’ s not the most nourishing food .
kiss her soft mouth , and we ’ ll be off .
farewell , hostess .
be thrifty .
and keep yourself hidden , i command you .
farewell .
adieu .
therefore the dukes of berri , bretagne , brabant , and orléans shall advance , and you , prince dauphin , will swiftly entrench and fortify our fortress towns with men of courage and the means to defend themselves .
the king of england ’ s approach is as forceful as a whirlpool .
let ’ s do it with no show of anxiety — no , with no more fear than if we ’ d heard that the english were busying themselves with folk dancing .
because , my good king , england is so poorly led , her scepter so foolishly borne by a vain , silly , shallow , impulsive youth , that she ’ s hardly a threat .
oh , please , prince dauphin !
you are completely wrong about this king .
you ’ ll discover that his youthful follies were like the persona that well , you ’ re wrong , my lord high constable .
but even if i thought you were right , it doesn ’ t matter .
when it comes to defense , it ’ s best to assume that the enemy is more powerful than he seems .
crowned by the golden sun , observed his heroic son and smiled to see him mangle the work of nature , french youth whose fathers and god had nurtured for twenty years , since they were babies .
this king is a branch of that same victorious stock .
ambassadors of harry , king of england , request a hearing with your majesty .
we ’ ll see them immediately .
bring them right in .
my good king , surprise the english and let them know what kind of kingdom you rule over .
self-love , my liege , is not so great a sin as self-neglect .
from our brother monarch , the king of england ?
and what will happen if i don ’ t ?
bloodshed will force you to .
i ’ ll think it over .
tomorrow , i ’ ll let you know what i ’ ve decided and what answer you should deliver to the king of england .
regarding the dauphin , you can speak to me .
what ’ s the message from the english king ?
scorn and defiance , indifference , contempt , and any insult that wouldn ’ t disgrace the mighty sender — that ’ s the value he puts on you .
to that end , i presented him with the tennis balls , the perfect expression of his inexperience and frivolity .
he ’ ll make your palace tremble for this insult , even if it were the mightiest in all of europe .
and , make no mistake , you ’ ll find , as we his subjects have , an amazing difference between the king as a young man and the way he is now .
we ’ ll give you an answer tomorrow .
don ’ t take too long , unless you want our king to come after me to ask what ’ s holding things up , because he ’ s already landed here .
you ’ ll have your answer soon .
a night isn ’ t much time for addressing matters of this importance .
and so , on the wings of imagination and at the speed of thought , our scene flies swiftly on .
picture the cabin boys climbing around the rigging .
hear the shrill whistle that brings order to the hubbub .
picture the linen sails driven by the invisible and subtle wind as they pull the vast hulls through the wrinkled sea , breasting the high waves .
pretend that you ’ re standing on the shore , watching a city dance on the shifting waves , and you ’ ll have an idea of the look of this majestic fleet as it holds a straight course for harfleur .
follow it , follow it !
once there , make your thoughts work harder , and witness a siege .
take in the wheeled canons with their deadly gaping mouths trained on the walled city of harfleur .
imagine the french ambassador returning to inform harry that the king offers him
his daughter , katherine , with some insignificant , unprofitable dukedoms as her dowry .
indulge us further and supplement our performance with your own imaginings .
attack the breach in the city wall once more , dear friends , attack it once more — or else let ’ s close it up with english corpses .
now grit your teeth and let your nostrils flare .
on , on , you noblest englishmen , descended as you are from battle-tested fathers , fathers who , like so many alexander the greats , have fought in these regions from morning until night , sheathing their swords only when there was no one left to fight .
don ’ t dishonor your mothers !
prove that the men you call your fathers did truly conceive you .
and you , good farmers , whose limbs were made in england , show us here the vigor of your upbringing .
prove you are worthy of your birth , which i do not doubt for a moment .
we are fortunate in the change .
listen to him talk about war , and you ’ ll hear elegant and thrilling accounts of the battles .
follow your spirit , and as you charge cry , “ god for harry , england , and saint george ! ”
on , on , on , on , on !
to the breach , to the breach !
please , corporal , stop !
you can see how it is all around .
i wish i were in an alehouse in london !
i would give all my glory for a mug of ale and safety .
me too .
up to the breach , you dogs !
go !
great duke , be merciful to mortal men .
dear man , calm your rage .
be lenient , dearest !
this is healthy talk .
your honor ’ s is unhealthy talk .
young though i am , i ’ ve been observing these three blowhards closely .
yet not one among them , if all three were to wait on me , could be my “ man , ” because three such fakes don ’ t amount to a man .
they will steal anything and call it spoils .
they would like me to be as familiar with men ’ s pockets as their gloves and handkerchiefs , which goes against my manhood , because to take something from another ’ s pocket and put it into my own is plain stealing .
i must leave them and seek some better employment .
their villainy nauseates me , and i must therefore vomit it up .
the tunnels !
for the enemy , see — and you can explain this to the duke , see — has dug its own tunnels four yards below ours .
by jesus , i think they will blow up everything if we don ’ t improve our tactics .
the duke of gloucester , who has command over the siege , is in consultation with an irishman , a very valiant gentleman indeed .
it ’ s captain macmorris , right ?
i think so .
jesus , he ’ s an ass if there ever was one !
i will say as much to his face .
he knows no more about the proper practice of war , see — the ancient practices — than a puppy .
here he comes with captain jamy , the scots captain .
captain jamy is a wonderfully valorous gentleman , that ’ s certain , one with great learning and knowledge concerning ancient warfare , i happen to know from his maneuvers .
by jesus , he will defend his position on the practices of the ancient roman wars as well as any military man in the world .
good day to you , captain fluellen .
good evening to your worship , good captain james .
tell me , captain macmorris , have you left the tunnels ?
have the excavators stopped work ?
christ , it ’ s a disaster .
i swear by this hand and my father ’ s soul , the whole thing is a disaster .
it ’ s all stopped .
i could have blown up the town in an hour .
oh , it ’ s a disaster , a disaster , by this hand , it ’ s a disaster .
captain macmorris , i beg your pardon , but would you grant me a discussion or two with you , see , partly touching on or concerning the practice of war , the roman wars , for the sake of argument , see , and friendly conversation ?
partly to confirm my opinion and partly for the satisfaction , see , of my mind , with respect to the demands of proper military practice — that ’ s the point ?
what endeavor , popillius ?
good luck .
look , he ’ s approaching caesar .
keep an eye on him .
brutus , what will we do ?
if our secret ’ s known , either caesar or i will die , for i ’ ll kill myself .
cassius , stand firm .
trebonius knows his cue .
where ’ s metellus cimber ?
he should go up and offer his petition to caesar now .
they ’ re speaking to him .
go up there and second his petition .
casca , you ’ ll be the first to raise your hand .
are we all ready ?
i have to stop you , cimber .
these kneelings and humble courtesies might excite ordinary men , flattering them into turning roman law into children ’ s games .
what , even you , brutus ?
i could be convinced if i were like you .
if i could beg others to change their minds , begging would convince me , too .
but i ’ m as immovable as the northern star , whose stable and stationary quality has no equal in the sky .
the sky shows countless stars .
so it is on earth .
to show you that that ’ s me , let me prove it a little even in this case .
enough !
would you try to lift mount olympus ?
haven ’ t i resisted even brutus , begging from his knees ?
hands , speak for me !
liberty !
freedom !
tyranny is dead !
run and proclaim it in the streets .
some should go to the public platforms and cry out , “ liberty , freedom , and democracy ! ” people and senators , don ’ t be afraid .
don ’ t run away — stay where you are .
go to the platform , brutus .
and cassius too .
where ’ s publius ?
stand close together , in case someone loyal to caesar tries to — don ’ t talk about standing together . — publius , cheer up .
we don ’ t intend any harm to you , nor to anyone else .
tell them this , publius .
and leave us , publius , in case the people storming us should harm you .
do so .
and let no one suffer for this deed except us , the perpetrators .
where ’ s antony ?
he ran to his house , stunned .
men , wives , and children stare , cry out , and run in the streets as though it were doomsday .
why , the man who shortens his life by twenty years cuts off twenty years of worrying about death .
kneel , romans , kneel , and let ’ s wash our hands , up to the elbows , in caesar ’ s blood and smear it on our swords .
then we ’ ll go out , even to the marketplace , and , waving our bloody swords over our heads , let ’ s cry , “ peace , freedom , and liberty ! ” kneel then , and wash .
who ’ s calling me ?
quiet , everyone !
quiet !
who in the crowd is calling me ?
i hear a voice more piercing than the music of these trumpets calling “ caesar ! ” speak .
caesar is listening .
beware of march 15th .
who ’ s that ?
a soothsayer tells you to beware of march 15th .
bring him in front of me .
let me see his face .
you , fellow , step out of the crowd .
this is caesar you ’ re looking at .
what do you have to say to me now ?
speak once again .
beware of march 15th .
he ’ s insane .
let ’ s leave him .
let ’ s move .
are you going to watch the race ?
how many times will caesar bleed again in show , though he now lies at the base of pompey ’ s statue , as worthless as dust !
yes , every man forward .
brutus will lead , and we ’ ll follow him with the boldest and best hearts of rome .
wait a minute .
who ’ s that coming ?
it ’ s a friend of antony ’ s .
your master is a wise and honorable roman .
i never thought any less of him .
tell him , if he comes here , i ’ ll explain everything to him and , on my word , he ’ ll leave unharmed .
i know that he ’ ll be on our side .
but here comes antony . — welcome , mark antony .
oh , mighty caesar !
do you lie so low ?
have all your conquests , glories , triumphs , achievements , come to so little ?
farewell .
gentlemen , i don ’ t know what you intend to do , who else you intend to kill , who else you consider corrupt .
if it ’ s me , there ’ s no time as good as this hour of caesar ’ s death , and no weapon better than your swords , covered with the noblest blood in the world .
i ask you , if you have a grudge against me , to kill me now , while your stained hands still reek of blood .
i could live a thousand years and i wouldn ’ t be as ready to die as i am now .
there ’ s no place i ’ d rather die than here by caesar , and no manner of death would please me more than being stabbed by you , the masters of this new era .
oh , antony , don ’ t beg us to kill you .
they are full of pity for caesar .
but a stronger pity , for the wrongs committed against rome , drove out our pity for caesar , as fire drives out fire , and so we killed him .
for you , our swords have blunt edges , too dull to harm you , mark antony .
our arms , which can be strong and cruel , and our hearts , filled with brotherly love , embrace you with kind love , good thoughts , and reverence .
your vote will be as strong as anyone ’ s in the reordering of the government .
but just be patient until we ’ ve calmed the masses , who are beside themselves with fear .
i don ’ t doubt your wisdom .
each of you , give me your bloody hand .
mark antony — pardon me , caius cassius .
i took your hands in friendship , but , indeed , i was distracted when i looked down at caesar .
i am friends with you all and love you all , on one condition — that you prove to me that caesar was dangerous .
our reasons are so well considered that even if you , antony , were caesar ’ s son , you would be satisfied with them .
you may , mark antony .
brutus , may i have a word with you ?
it ’ ll help us more than hurt us .
mark antony , take caesar ’ s body .
you will not blame us in your funeral speech , but will say all the good you want to about caesar and that you do it by our permission .
and you ’ ll speak on the same platform as i do , after i ’ m done .
so be it .
i don ’ t want anything more .
prepare the body , then , and follow us .
you are what ’ s left of the noblest man that ever lived .
pity the hand that shed this valuable blood .
over your wounds — which , like speechless mouths , open their red lips , as though to beg me to speak — i predict that a curse will fall upon the bodies of men .
fierce civil war will paralyze all of italy .
i do , mark antony .
caesar wrote for him to come to rome .
he received caesar ’ s letters , and he is coming .
grief seems to be contagious , for my eyes , seeing the tears in yours , began to fill .
is your master coming ?
he rests tonight within twenty-one miles of rome .
report back to him fast and tell him what has happened .
don ’ t go back until i ’ ve carried the corpse into the marketplace .
help me here .
we want answers .
give us answers .
then follow me and listen to my speech , friends .
cassius , go to the next street and divide the crowd .
let those who will hear me speak stay .
lead those away who will follow you , and we ’ ll explain publicly the reasons for caesar ’ s death .
i ’ ll listen to brutus .
i ’ ll listen to cassius , and we will compare their reasons .
noble brutus has mounted the platform .
be patient until i finish .
romans , countrymen , and friends !
listen to my reasons and be silent so you can hear .
believe me on my honor and keep my honor in mind , so you may believe me .
be wise when you criticize me and keep your minds alert so you can judge me fairly .
if there ’ s anyone in this assembly , any dear friend of caesar ’ s , i say to him that my love for caesar was no less than his .
if , then , that friend demands to know why i rose up against caesar , this is my answer : it ’ s not that i loved caesar less , but that i loved rome more .
would you rather that caesar were living and we would all go to our graves as slaves , or that caesar were dead and we all lived as free men ?
i weep for caesar in that he was good to me .
i rejoice in his good fortune .
i honor him for being brave .
but his ambition — for that , i killed him .
there are tears for his love , joy for his fortune , honor for his bravery , and death for his ambition .
who here is so low that he wants to be a slave ?
if there are any , speak , for it is he whom i ’ ve offended .
who here is so barbarous that he doesn ’ t want to be a roman ?
if there are any , speak , for it is he whom i ’ ve offended .
who here is so vile that he doesn ’ t love his country ?
if there are any , speak , for it is he whom i have offended .
i will pause for a reply .
no one , brutus , no one .
then i have offended no one .
i ’ ve done no more to caesar than you will do to me .
the reasons for his death are recorded in the capitol .
his glory has not been diminished where he earned it , nor have those offenses for which he was killed been exaggerated .
here comes his body , mourned by mark antony , who , though he had no part in the killing , will benefit from his death — receiving a share in the commonwealth , as you all will .
live , brutus !
live , live !
let ’ s carry him in triumph to his house !
i don ’ t like sports .
i ’ m not competitive like antony .
but don ’ t let me keep you from going , cassius .
i ’ ll go my own way .
cassius , don ’ t take it badly .
tell me , good brutus , can you see your face ?
let him become caesar !
caesar ’ s better qualities exist in brutus , and we will crown him .
we ’ ll bring him to his house with shouts and celebration !
my countrymen — silence !
brutus speaks .
quiet there !
good countrymen , let me leave alone .
i ask that none of you leave , except myself , until antony has finished .
let him mount the pulpit .
we ’ ll listen to him .
for brutus ’ s sake , i am indebted to you .
what does he say about brutus ?
he says that for brutus ’ s sake he finds himself indebted to us all .
he ’ d better not speak badly of brutus here .
caesar was a tyrant .
that ’ s for sure .
we ’ re lucky that rome is rid of him .
quiet !
let ’ s hear what antony has to say .
you gentle romans — quiet there !
let us hear him .
friends , romans , countrymen , give me your attention .
i have come here to bury caesar , not to praise him .
the evil that men do is remembered after their deaths , but the good is often buried with them .
it might as well be the same with caesar .
the noble brutus told you that caesar was ambitious .
if that ’ s true , it ’ s a serious fault , and caesar has paid seriously for it .
with the permission of brutus and the others — for brutus is an honorable man ; they are all honorable men — i have come here to speak at caesar ’ s funeral .
he was my friend , he was faithful and just to me .
but brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .
he brought many captives home to rome whose ransoms brought wealth to the city .
is this the work of an ambitious man ?
when the poor cried , caesar cried too .
ambition shouldn ’ t be so soft .
yet brutus says he was ambitious , and brutus is an honorable man .
you all saw that on the lupercal feast day i offered him a king ’ s crown three times , and he refused it three times .
was this ambition ?
i am not here to disprove what brutus has said , but to say what i think there ’ s a lot of sense in what he says .
if you think about it correctly , caesar has suffered a great wrong .
has he , sirs ?
caesar wouldn ’ t take the crown .
therefore it ’ s certain that he wasn ’ t ambitious .
if it turns out he wasn ’ t , certain people are going to get it .
poor man !
antony ’ s eyes are fiery red from crying .
there isn ’ t a nobler man than antony in all of rome .
only yesterday the word of caesar might have stood against the world .
now he lies there worth nothing , and no one is so humble as to show him respect .
oh , sirs , if i stirred your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage , i would offend brutus and cassius , who , you all know , are honorable men .
i will not do them wrong .
i would rather wrong the dead , and wrong myself and you , than wrong such honorable men .
but here ’ s a paper with caesar ’ s seal on it .
we want to hear the will .
read it , mark antony .
the will , the will !
we want to hear caesar ’ s will .
it isn ’ t proper for you to know how much caesar loved you .
you aren ’ t wood , you aren ’ t stones — you ’ re men .
and , being men , the contents of caesar ’ s will would enrage you .
read the will .
we want to hear it , antony .
you have to read us the will , caesar ’ s will .
will you be patient ?
will you wait awhile ?
i ’ ve said too much in telling you of it .
i ’ m afraid that i wrong the honorable men whose daggers have stabbed caesar .
they were traitors .
the testament !
they were villains , murderers .
the will !
read the will !
you force me to read the will , then ?
then make a circle around caesar ’ s corpse , and let me show you the man who made this will .
shall i come down ?
will you let me ?
come down .
descend .
we ’ ll let you .
stand away from the hearse .
stand away from the body .
make room for antony , most noble antony !
no , don ’ t press up against me .
stand further away .
stand back .
give him room .
if you have tears , prepare to shed them now .
you all know this cloak .
i remember the first time caesar ever put it on .
it was the day he overcame the nervii warriors .
look , here ’ s where cassius ’ s dagger pierced it .
see the wound that casca made .
for brutus , as you know , was caesar ’ s angel .
the gods know how dearly caesar loved him !
this was the most unkind cut of all .
and at the base of pompey ’ s statue , with his cloak covering his face , which was dripping with blood the whole time , great caesar fell .
oh , what a fall it was , my countrymen !
then you and i and all of us fell down , while bloody treason triumphed .
oh , now you weep , and i sense that you feel pity .
these are gracious tears .
but if it overwhelms you to look at caesar ’ s wounded cloak , how will you feel , kind men , now ?
look at this , here is the man — scarred , as you can see , by traitors .
oh , what a sad sight !
oh , noble caesar !
oh , sad day !
oh , traitors , villains !
oh , most bloody sight !
revenge !
seek !
burn !
set fire !
kill !
slay !
wait , countrymen .
quiet there !
listen to the noble antony .
those who have done this deed are honorable .
i don ’ t know what private grudges they had that made them do it .
they ’ re wise and honorable , and will no doubt give you reasons for it .
i haven ’ t come to steal your loyalty , friends .
i have neither cleverness nor rhetorical skill nor the authority nor gesture nor eloquence nor the power of speech to stir men up .
i just speak directly .
but if i were brutus and brutus were me , then i ’ d stir you up , and install in each of caesar ’ s wounds the kind of voice that could convince even stones to rise up and mutiny .
we ’ ll mutiny .
we ’ ll burn brutus ’ s house .
let ’ s go , then !
come , find the conspirators !
wait , and listen to me , countrymen .
quiet !
wait !
listen to antony .
most noble antony !
why , friends , you don ’ t even know what you ’ re doing yet .
what has caesar done to deserve your love ?
alas , you don ’ t know .
i must tell you then .
you ’ ve forgotten the will i told you about .
yes !
the will !
let ’ s stay and hear the will !
most noble caesar !
we ’ ll revenge his death .
oh , royal caesar !
listen to me patiently .
quiet , there !
also , he ’ s left you all his walkways — in his private gardens and newly planted orchards — on this side of the tiber river .
he ’ s left them to you and to your heirs forever — public pleasures in which you will be able to stroll and relax .
here was a caesar !
when will there be another like him ?
we ’ ll burn his body in the holy place and use the brands to set the traitors ' houses on fire .
take up the body .
we ’ ll start a fire .
now , let it work .
what ’ s up , my man ?
sir , octavius has already arrived in rome .
where is he ?
he and lepidus are at caesar ’ s house .
i will go straight to visit him .
i ask for him , and he comes .
fortune is happy today and , in this mood , will give us anything we want .
i heard octavius say that brutus and cassius have ridden like madmen through the gates of rome .
they probably received warning about how much i stirred up the people .
take me to octavius .
that ’ s true .
and it ’ s too bad , brutus , that you don ’ t have any mirrors that could display your hidden excellence to yourself .
i ’ ve heard many of the noblest romans — next to immortal caesar — speaking of you , complaining of the tyranny of today ’ s government , and wishing that your eyes were working better .
what dangers are you trying to lead me into , cassius , that you want me to look inside myself for something that ’ s not there ?
i ’ ll tell you , good brutus .
and since you know you can see yourself best by reflection , i ’ ll be your mirror and show you , without exaggeration , things inside you that you can ’ t see .
and don ’ t be suspicious of me , noble brutus .
why are they shouting ?
i ’ m afraid the people have made caesar their king .
really , are you afraid of that ?
then i have to assume you don ’ t want him to be king .
i dreamed last night that i feasted with caesar , and unlucky signs overwhelmed my imagination .
i have no desire to go outside , yet something leads me there .
what ’ s your name ?
where are you going ?
where do you live ?
are you a married man or a bachelor ?
answer all of us , now .
yes , and be brief .
yes , and be wise .
what ’ s my name ?
where am i going ?
where do i live ?
am i a married man or a bachelor ?
then , to answer every man briefly , wisely , and truthfully — wisely i say , i am a bachelor .
you imply that married men are fools .
you ’ ll get a blow from me for that , i think .
right this instant , i ’ m going to caesar ’ s funeral .
as a friend or an enemy ?
as a friend .
getting right to the point , i live near the capitol .
tell us your name , sir , truthfully .
truthfully , my name is cinna .
tear him to pieces .
he ’ s a conspirator .
i ’ m not cinna the conspirator .
it doesn ’ t matter .
his name ’ s cinna .
pull only his name out of his heart and let him go .
tear him apart , tear him up !
come , firebrands , over here !
to brutus ’ s , to cassius ’ s , let ’ s burn them all .
some of you go to decius ’ s house and some to casca ’ s .
some to ligarius ’ s .
go !
these ones , then , will be assassinated .
their names are marked .
i agree — put a mark next to his name too , antony .
on the condition that your sister ’ s son , publius , also must die , mark antony .
he will die .
see — i ’ ve sealed his fate with this mark next to his name .
but , lepidus , go to caesar ’ s house .
bring his will here , and we ’ ll figure out a way to reduce his bequests to the people .
will you be here when i return ?
either here or at the capitol .
he ’ s an unremarkable man , fit only to be sent on errands .
does it really make sense , once we divide the world into three parts , that he should be one of the three rulers ?
octavius , i ’ m older than you are .
once he ’ s carried our treasure where we want it , we ’ ll free him of the load and turn him loose like a jackass , to shake his ears and graze in the public pastures .
you can do what you want , but he ’ s an experienced and honorable soldier .
so is my horse , octavius , and for that reason i give him all the hay he wants .
stop .
pass on the command to halt !
what ’ s happening now , lucillius ?
is cassius nearby ?
he ’ s nearby , and pindarus has come to salute you on behalf of his master .
if he ’ s nearby , i want an explanation .
can i have a word with you , lucillius ?
he received me with courtesy and sufficient respect , but not with affection , nor with as much open and friendly conversation as he once greeted me .
you ’ ve described a warm friend who ’ s cooling off .
plain and simple loyalty doesn ’ t make anyone act phony .
but insincere men , like horses who are too lively at the start of a race , make a big show of their spirit .
but when push comes to shove , they droop like those horses that are all show and slow to a crawl .
is his army approaching ?
they plan to spend the night in sardis .
the larger part , the main body of cavalry , are coming with cassius .
look !
he ’ s arrived .
march to meet him at a dignified pace .
halt .
halt !
pass the order along .
halt !
halt !
halt !
most noble brother , you have done me wrong .
let the gods judge me !
do i mistreat even my enemies ?
and when you do — cassius , calm down .
let ’ s not argue here in front of both our armies , which ought to see nothing but love between us .
order them to move back .
then , in my tent , you can elaborate on your complaints , and i ’ ll listen .
pindarus , order our commanders to lead their charges a little ways away from this ground .
have lucius and titinius guard the door .
my evidence that you have wronged me is that you condemned and disgraced lucius pella for taking bribes here from the sardinians , and you ignored my letters , where i argued that he was innocent ; i know the man .
you wronged yourself to write on behalf of such a man .
in a time like this , it doesn ’ t make sense to criticize every offense .
i ’ ll tell you , cassius , you yourself have been called greedy and been accused of giving your positions to undeserving men in exchange for gold .
me , “ greedy ” !
you know , if you were anyone other than brutus , that speech would be your last .
the name of cassius gives credit to these corrupt actions , and so they go unpunished .
unpunished !
remember march , march 15th .
didn ’ t great caesar bleed for the sake of justice ?
who among us stabbed him for any cause but justice ?
should we now dirty our fingers with lowly bribes and sell the mighty offices that we hold for whatever money we can get our hands on ?
i ’ d rather be a dog and howl at the moon than be that kind of roman .
brutus , do not provoke me .
i will not take it .
you ’ re forgetting yourself when you back me into a corner .
i ’ m a soldier , more experienced than you , and better able to give orders .
get lost !
you are not , cassius .
i am .
i say you ’ re not .
don ’ t provoke me any further or i ’ ll forget to restrain myself .
if you care about your health , you won ’ t push me any further .
leave , you little man .
is this possible ?
listen to me , for i have something to tell you .
does a madman scare me when he stares at me ?
but why do you keep me here so long ?
what do you want to tell me ?
i know this quality in you , brutus — it ’ s as familiar to me as your face .
indeed , honor is what i want to talk to you about .
i don ’ t know what you and other men think of this life , but as for me , i ’ d rather not live at all than live to worship a man as ordinary as myself .
i was born as free as caesar .
so were you .
we both have eaten as well , and we can both endure the cold winter as well as he .
and he did .
all this ” ?
yes , and more .
go ahead — rage till your proud heart breaks .
show your slaves how mad you are , and make your servants tremble .
has it come to this ?
you say you ’ re a better soldier .
show it !
make your boasts come true , and i ’ ll be thrilled .
i ’ m always happy to hear about brave men .
you wrong me in every way .
you wrong me , brutus .
when caesar was alive , even he wouldn ’ t dare anger me like this .
oh , be quiet .
you wouldn ’ t have dared to tempt him so .
i wouldn ’ t have dared !
no .
you wouldn ’ t have dared , out of fear for your life .
don ’ t take my love for granted .
i might do something i ’ ll be sorry for .
you ’ ve already done something you should be sorry for .
your threats don ’ t scare me , cassius , because i ’ m so secure in my honesty and integrity that they pass me by like a weak breeze .
i asked you for gold to pay my soldiers , and you wouldn ’ t give it to me .
was that the caius cassius that i knew ?
and would i have ever done that to you ?
i didn ’ t refuse you .
you did .
i didn ’ t .
the man who brought my answer to you was a fool .
you have broken my heart .
a friend should put up with his friend ’ s weaknesses , but you exaggerate mine .
i don ’ t until you practice them on me .
you don ’ t love me .
i don ’ t like your faults .
a friend would never see those faults .
no , a flatterer wouldn ’ t , even if the faults were as huge as mount olympus .
oh , i could weep my soul right out of myself !
there ’ s my dagger put away your dagger .
be angry whenever you like , it ’ s all right with me .
do whatever you want , and i ’ ll say your insults are just a bad mood .
when i said that , i was angry too .
you admit it , then ?
give me your hand .
and my heart too .
oh , brutus !
what ’ s the matter ?
do you have enough love for me to be patient when my bad temper , which i inherited from my mother , makes me forget how i should behave ?
yes , cassius .
and from now on , when you get hot with me , i ’ ll assume it ’ s your mother speaking and leave it at that .
what ’ s this !
what ’ s the matter ?
you should be ashamed , generals !
what do you think you ’ re doing ?
love each other and be friends , like two such men should be .
listen to me , because i ’ m older than you , surely .
be patient with him , brutus .
that ’ s just how he is .
i ’ ll humor him when he learns how to behave .
what should we do with all these rhyming fools that follow us from post to post ?
get out of here , my friend .
away , away , be gone .
lucillius and titinius , order the commanders to have the men camp for the night .
and return to us immediately , bringing messala with you .
i didn ’ t think you could even be so angry .
oh cassius , i ’ m tired out by many sorrows .
portia is dead .
portia !
she is dead .
what an irreplaceable and grievous loss !
what sickness did she die of ?
she was worried about my absence , and about the fact that young octavius and mark antony have grown so strong — which i found out at the same time as the news of her death .
and that ’ s how she died ?
yes , like that .
oh , immortal gods !
my heart is thirsty for that noble promise .
fill my cup , lucius , until the wine overflows it .
i cannot drink too much of brutus ’ s love .
now let ’ s sit closely around this candle and discuss our needs .
portia , are you really gone ?
no more about that , please .
messala , i have received these letters explaining that young octavius and mark antony are rushing toward philippi and bearing down upon us with a mighty power .
i have received letters that say the same .
and anything else ?
that with a series of legal writs , octavius , antony , and lepidus have put a hundred senators to death .
on that point , our letters don ’ t agree .
my letters say only seventy senators were killed , one being cicero .
cicero too ?
cicero is dead , by their decree .
no , messala .
and you haven ’ t heard any news about her in your letters ?
nothing , messala .
i think that ’ s strange .
why do you ask ?
have you heard something of her in your letters ?
no , my lord .
now , as you ’ re a roman , tell me the truth .
then you must take the truth i have to tell like a roman .
it ’ s certain that she is dead , and she died in a strange way .
well , good-bye , portia .
we all must die , messala .
having already thought about the fact that she would have to die sometime , i can endure her death now .
that ’ s the way great men ought to endure great losses .
i ’ ve practiced stoicism with as much devotion as you , but i still couldn ’ t bear this news like you do .
well , let ’ s move on to our work with the living .
what do you think of marching to philippi immediately ?
i don ’ t think it ’ s a good idea .
why not ?
here ’ s why : it ’ d be better for the enemy to come after us .
that way , he ’ ll waste his provisions and tire out his soldiers , weakening his own capacities , while we , lying still , are rested , energetic , and nimble .
if we meet him at philippi , these people will be at our backs .
listen to me , good brother .
our regiments are full to the brim ; our cause is ready .
the enemy gets larger each day .
we , now at our largest , can only decrease .
it ’ s on such a high tide that we ’ re now floating , and we must take the current when it is offered , or lose our campaign .
if that ’ s what you want , all right .
we ’ ll go forward with you and meet them at philippi .
it ’ s now late at night , and actions must accommodate bodily needs , which we ’ ll satisfy with only a short rest .
that ’ s all there is to say .
there ’ s nothing else .
good night .
we ’ ll rise and leave early tomorrow .
lucius !
let ’ s pray that we never come into conflict like that again .
let ’ s not , brutus .
and this is the man who has now become a god , and i ’ m a wretched creature who must bow down if caesar so much as carelessly nods my way .
in spain , caesar had a fever , and it made him shake .
it ’ s true , this so-called “ god ” — he shook .
his cowardly lips turned white , and the same eye whose gaze terrifies the world lost its gleam .
i heard him groan — yes , i did — and the same tongue that ordered the romans to obey him and transcribe his speeches in their books cried , “ give me some water , titinius , ” like a sick girl .
it astounds me that such a weak man could beat the whole world and carry the trophy of victory alone .
more shouting !
i think this applause is for some new honors awarded to caesar .
why , caesar straddles the narrow world like a giant , and we petty men walk under his huge legs and look forward only to dying dishonorably , as slaves .
men can be masters of their fate .
it is not destiny ’ s fault , but our own faults , that we ’ re slaves .
brutus ” and “ caesar . ” what ’ s so special about “ caesar ” ?
why should that name be proclaimed more than yours ?
write them together — yours is just as good a name .
pronounce them — it is just as nice to say .
everything ’ s fine .
good night , my lord .
good night , good brother .
good night , lord brutus .
farewell , everyone .
give me the gown .
where ’ s your lute ?
here in the tent .
what , are you sleepy ?
call claudio and some of my other men .
i ’ ll have them sleep on cushions in my tent .
varrus and claudio !
did you call , my lord ?
sirs , i ask you to sleep in my tent .
i might wake you up in a while to send you on an errand to my brother cassius .
if you like , we ’ ll stand by and wait to do whatever you need .
look , lucius , here ’ s the book i was searching for .
i put it in the pocket of my nightgown .
i was sure that you hadn ’ t given it to me .
can you stay awake a bit longer and play a few tunes on your lute ?
yes , my lord , if you would like .
i would , my boy .
i ask too much of you , but you ’ re always willing .
it ’ s my duty , sir .
i shouldn ’ t make you do more than you ’ re able .
i know that young men look forward to their rest .
i ’ ve already slept , my lord .
that was good planning , and you ’ ll sleep some more .
i won ’ t keep you very long .
if i live through this , i ’ ll be good to you .
this is a sleepy tune .
gentle boy , good night .
i won ’ t trouble you so much as to wake you .
good night , good boy .
let me see , let me see .
didn ’ t i turn down the page where i left off reading ?
here it is , i think .
i think it ’ s my bad eyesight that ’ s making me see this horrible vision .
it ’ s coming toward me .
are you a god , an angel , or a devil , that you make my blood turn cold and my hair stand up ?
tell me what you are .
i ’ m your evil spirit , brutus .
why do you come here ?
to tell you that you ’ ll see me at philippi .
then i ’ ll see you again ?
yes , at philippi .
alright , then i ’ ll see you at philippi .
evil spirit , i want to talk some more .
claudio !
claudio !
he thinks he ’ s still playing his instrument .
lucius , wake up !
my lord ?
were you dreaming , lucius ?
my lord , i don ’ t think i cried out .
yes , you did .
did you see anything ?
nothing , my lord .
my lord ?
my lord ?
why did you cry out in your sleep ?
did we , my lord ?
yes .
did you see anything ?
no , my lord , i didn ’ t see anything .
me neither , my lord .
go to my brother cassius .
order him to advance his forces first thing , and we ’ ll follow .
yes , my lord .
now , antony , our prayers have been answered .
you said the enemy wouldn ’ t come down but keep to the hills and upper regions .
it seems not .
their forces are nearby .
they intend to challenge us here at philippi , responding to our challenge before we ’ ve even challenged him .
i know how they think , and i understand why they ’ re doing this .
they really wish they were somewhere else , but they want to descend on us , looking fierce so we ’ ll think they ’ re brave .
but they aren ’ t .
prepare yourselves , generals .
the enemy approaches with great display .
they show their bloody heralds of battle , and something must be done immediately .
octavius , lead your forces slowly out to the left side of the level field .
i ’ ll go to the right side .
you stay on the left .
why are you defying me in this urgent matter ?
they want to talk .
stay here , titinius .
we have to go out and talk to them .
mark antony , should we give the signal to attack ?
no , octavius caesar , we ’ ll respond to their charge .
go forward .
the generals want to speak with us .
words before fighting .
is that how it is , countrymen ?
not that we love words more than fighting , like you do .
good words are better than bad strokes , octavius .
brutus , you give a nice speech along with your evil strokes .
but your words are as sweet as honey — you ’ ve stolen from the bees and left them with nothing .
i took their stings too , wouldn ’ t you say ?
villains , you didn ’ t do even that much when your vile daggers struck each other as they hacked up caesar ’ s sides .
now , brutus , you have only yourself to thank .
come , come , let ’ s remember why we ’ re here .
if arguing makes us sweat , the real trial will turn that water to blood .
caesar , you ’ re not going to be killed by a traitor — unless you kill yourself ..
i hope you ’ re right .
i wasn ’ t born to die on your sword .
if you were the noblest of your family , young man , you couldn ’ t die more honorably .
an annoying schoolboy , unworthy of such an honor , joined by a masquerader and a partier !
still the same old cassius !
if you dare to fight today , come to the field .
if not , come when you have the courage .
now let the wind blow , waves swell , and ships sink !
the storm has begun and everything is at stake .
messala !
messala , today is my birthday — i was born on this very day .
give me your hand , messala .
you ’ ll be my witness that i ’ ve been forced , as pompey was , to wager all of our freedoms on one battle .
you know that i used to believe in epicurus and his disregard for omens .
i ’ ve changed my mind now and partly believe in omens .
traveling from sardis , two mighty eagles fell on our front flag and perched there , eating from the hands of the soldiers who ’ d accompanied us to philippi .
this morning , they ’ ve flown away and in their place are ravens , crows , and kites , flying over our heads and looking down on us , as though we were sickly prey .
their shadows are like a deadly canopy , under which our army lies , ready to die .
don ’ t believe in this .
i only partly believe it , for i ’ m enthusiastic and resolved to meet all dangers without wavering .
now , most noble brutus , the gods are friendly with us today so that we , who want peace , can live on to old age !
but since the affairs of men are always uncertain , let ’ s think about the worst that may happen .
if we lose this battle , this is the last time we ’ ll speak to each other .
if we lose , what do you plan to do ?
cast spells with them , and “ brutus ” will call up a ghost as well as “ caesar . ” now , in the name of all the gods , i ask you what food does caesar eat that has made him grow so great ?
our era should be ashamed !
rome has lost the ability to raise noble men !
when was there ever an age , since the beginning of time , that didn ’ t feature more than one famous man ?
until now , no one could say that only one man mattered in all of vast rome .
now , though , in all of rome , there ’ s room for only one man .
you and i have heard our fathers talk of another brutus — your ancestor — who would ’ ve let the devil himself reign in his roman republic before he let a king rule .
i have no doubt that you love me .
i ’ m beginning to understand what you want me to do .
what i think about this , and about what ’ s happening here in rome , i ’ ll tell you later .
for now , don ’ t try to persuade me anymore — i ask you as a friend .
i ’ ll think over what you ’ ve said , i ’ ll listen patiently to whatever else you have to say , and i ’ ll find a good time for us to discuss further such weighty matters .
until then , my noble friend , think about this : i ’ d rather be a poor villager than call myself a citizen of rome under the hard conditions that this time is likely to put us through .
i ’ m glad that my weak words have provoked even this small show of protest from you .
then if we lose this battle , you ’ ll be willing to be led in chains through the streets of rome ?
no , cassius , no .
don ’ t imagine that i ’ ll ever allow myself to return to rome in chains .
my mind is too great for that .
therefore , accept my everlasting farewell .
forever and forever , farewell , cassius !
if we meet again , then we ’ ll smile .
if not , then this parting was well done .
forever and forever , farewell , brutus !
if we meet again , then we ’ ll smile indeed .
if not , it ’ s true , this parting was well done .
well , lead on .
oh , i wish i could know what will happen today before it happens !
but it ’ s enough to know that the day will end , and then the end will be known .
let ’ s go !
ride , ride , messala , ride , and give these dispatches to our forces on the other side .
they should advance immediately , because i sense octavius ’ s side is a bit fainthearted right now , and a sudden push would overthrow him .
ride , ride , messala .
i ’ ve become an enemy to my own soldiers !
oh , cassius , brutus gave the orders too soon .
retreat further , my lord , retreat further .
mark antony is in your tents , my lord .
therefore you must run , noble cassius .
are those my tents on fire ?
they are , my lord .
titinius , if you love me , get on your horse and spur him on until he ’ s brought you to those troops and back again , so that i can find out whether those troops are friends or enemies .
i ’ ll be back quicker than you can think a thought .
go , pindarus , climb a little higher on this hill .
my eyesight has always been bad .
watch titinius and tell me what you see in the field .
today was the day i breathed my first breath .
time has come round , and i ’ ll end where i began .
my life has run its circle .
what news ?
and listen !
they shout for joy .
come down , look no more .
oh , i ’ m such a coward for living long enough to see my best friend taken before my eyes !
come here , boy .
come now , keep your oath .
caesar , you are revenged with the very same sword that killed you .
so i ’ m free .
but i didn ’ t want to be free like this .
oh , cassius , i ’ ll run far from this country to where no romans can find me .
the armies have merely changed places , titinius , because octavius has been overthrown by noble brutus ’ s forces at the very moment that antony overthrew cassius ’ s legions .
this news will comfort cassius .
where did you leave him ?
on this hill and in despair , with his slave pindarus .
isn ’ t that him on the ground ?
he doesn ’ t seem to be alive .
oh , my heart !
isn ’ t that him ?
pindarus !
where are you , pindarus ?
look for him , titinius , while i go to meet the noble brutus and force him to hear this news .
i say “ force ” because brutus would rather i stuck sharp blades and poisoned arrows in his ears than fill them with this .
hurry , messala , and i ’ ll look for pindarus in the meantime .
why did you send me out , brave cassius ?
didn ’ t i meet up with your allies ?
and didn ’ t they place the wreath of victory on my brow and order me to give it to you ?
didn ’ t you hear their shouts ?
alas , you misunderstood everything !
but let me place this wreath on your head .
your brutus ordered me to give it to you , and i ’ ll do what he says .
where is his body , messala ?
over there , where titinius mourns it .
titinius is lying face-up .
he ’ s been killed .
oh , julius caesar , you are still powerful .
your ghost walks the earth and turns our swords toward our own stomachs .
could you have found two romans as good as these two ?
good-bye to you , the last of all the romans .
i will find the time to cry for you , cassius , i ’ ll find the time .
come , then , and send his body to thasos .
let ’ s proceed to the field .
labio and flavio , push our armies onward .
it is three o 'clock , and , romans , before night , we will try our luck in a second battle .
who is so low that he wouldn ’ t ?
who will advance with me ?
i will proclaim my name around the field .
i am the son of marcus cato !
an enemy to tyrants and a friend to my country .
i am the son of marcus cato !
and i am brutus , marcus brutus .
brutus , my country ’ s friend .
know that i am brutus !
oh , young and noble cato , have you been slain ?
i ’ d rather die .
here is some money for you to kill me immediately .
kill brutus and be honored by the killing .
we must not .
he is a noble prisoner !
make room !
tell antony that brutus has been taken .
i ’ ll tell him the news .
where is he ?
he ’ s safe , antony .
i can assure you that no enemy will ever take the noble brutus alive .
the gods protect him from so great a shame !
the games are done and caesar is returning .
as they pass by , grab casca by the sleeve , and he ’ ll tell you if anything important happened today — in his usual sour way .
i ’ ll do so .
but look , cassius , caesar looks angry and everyone else looks as if they ’ ve been scolded .
calphurnia ’ s face is pale , and cicero ’ s eyes are as red and fiery as they get when senators are arguing with him at the capitol .
casca will tell us what ’ s the matter .
antonio !
caesar ?
come , last of my friends , rest on this rock .
statilius waved the torchlight at us , but he hasn ’ t come back .
he ’ s been captured or killed .
sit down , clitus .
listen , clitus .
who , me , my lord ?
no , not for all the world .
silence , then !
don ’ t give it away .
i ’ d rather kill myself .
listen , dardanius .
would i dare do something like that ?
oh dardanius !
oh clitus !
come here , good volumnius .
listen a minute .
what is it , my lord ?
once at sardis and once last night , here in philippi fields .
i know that my hour has come .
no , it hasn ’ t , my lord .
no , i ’ m sure it has , volumnius .
you see how the world goes , volumnius .
our enemies have driven us to the edge of the grave .
it ’ s nobler to leap in ourselves than dawdle until they push us .
good volumnius , you know that we went to school together .
for the sake of our old friendship , i ask you , hold my sword handle while i run on it .
that ’ s not a job for a friend , my lord .
run , run , my lord .
we can ’ t wait here .
farewell to you , and you , and you , volumnius .
strato , you ’ ve slept this whole time .
i ’ ll have glory in this losing day — more than octavius and mark antony will gain by their foul conquest .
so farewell , all , for my tongue has almost finished with its life .
i can ’ t see ahead of me .
my bones want to rest after helping me up to this hour .
run , my lord , run .
go on !
i ’ ll follow .
i beg you , strato , stay by me .
you ’ re a man with a good reputation .
your life has had honor in it .
then , hold my sword and turn your face away while i run on it .
will you , strato ?
give me your hand , first .
farewell , good strato .
what man is that ?
free from the bondage you are in , messala .
i ’ ll take all who served brutus into my service .
you , will you join with me ?
yes , if messala recommends me to you .
do so , good messala .
how did my master die , strato ?
i held the sword and he ran on it .
then take this man into your service , octavius , for he did the final service to my master .
this was the noblest roman of them all .
all the rest of the conspirators acted out of jealousy of great caesar .
only he acted from honesty and for the general good .
his body will lie in my tent tonight , with the honorable observance that suits a soldier .
so order the armies to rest , and let ’ s go home to share the glories of this happy day .
yes , casca .
tell us what happened today that put caesar in such a serious mood .
but you were with him , weren ’ t you ?
if i were , i wouldn ’ t need to ask you what happened .
a crown was offered to him , and he pushed it away with the back of his hand , like this — and then the people started shouting .
what was the second noise for ?
the same thing .
they shouted three times .
what was the last cry for ?
for the same thing .
the crown was offered to him three times ?
yes , indeed , it was , and he pushed it away three times , each time more gently than the last ; and at each refusal my countrymen shouted .
who offered him the crown ?
antony .
tell us how it happened , noble casca .
i can ’ t explain it .
then antony offered it to him again , and he refused it again ( though , in my opinion , he was reluctant to take his hand off it ) .
then antony offered it the third time .
as for myself , i didn ’ t dare laugh , for fear of opening my lips and inhaling the stinking air .
but wait a minute , please .
did you say caesar fainted ?
he fell down in the marketplace and foamed at the mouth and was speechless .
that ’ s very likely .
he has epilepsy , a disease where you fall down .
no , caesar doesn ’ t have epilepsy .
you and i , and honest casca , we have epilepsy — we ’ ve fallen .
i don ’ t know what you mean by that , but i ’ m sure caesar fell down .
what did he say when he regained consciousness ?
indeed , before he fell down , when he realized the commoners were glad he refused the crown , he pulled open his robe and offered them his throat to cut .
if i ’ d been a common laborer and hadn ’ t taken him up on his offer , to hell with me .
and so he fainted .
when he regained consciousness again , he said that if he ’ d done or said anything wrong , he wanted them to know that it was all because of his sickness .
three or four women near me cried , “ alas , good soul ! ” and forgave him with all their hearts .
but never mind them — if caesar had stabbed their mothers , they would ’ ve forgiven him .
and after that he came back here looking so serious ?
yes .
get out of here !
go home , you lazy men .
what , is today a holiday ?
i ’ m a carpenter , sir .
where are your leather apron and your ruler ?
what are you doing , wearing your best clothes ?
and you , sir , what ’ s well , compared to a fine workman , you might call me a mere cobbler .
but what ’ s your trade ?
answer me straightforwardly .
it is a trade , sir , that i practice with a clear conscience .
what trade , boy ?
you insolent rascal , what trade ?
sir , please , don ’ t be angry .
but if your soles are worn out , i can mend you .
what do you mean by that ?
mend ” me , you impertinent fellow ?
did cicero say anything ?
yes , he said something in greek .
what did he say ?
if i told you i understood greek , i ’ d be lying .
but those who understood him smiled at one another and shook their heads .
as for myself , it was greek to me .
i have more news too .
murellus and flavius have been punished for pulling scarves off statues of caesar .
there you go .
there was even more foolishness , if i could only remember it .
will you have dinner with me tonight , casca ?
no , i have a commitment .
will you dine with me tomorrow ?
yes , if i ’ m still alive , and you ’ re still sane , and your dinner is worth eating .
good .
i ’ ll expect you .
do so .
farewell to you both .
what a stupid man he ’ s become !
he was so sharp when he was in school .
he ’ s still sharp when it comes to carrying out a bold or noble enterprise , though he puts on this show of stupidity .
he speaks roughly , but what he says is smart , and his roughness makes other people enjoy listening to him .
you ’ re right , that ’ s how it is .
i ’ ll leave you for now .
if you ’ d like to talk tomorrow , i ’ ll come to your home .
or , if you don ’ t mind , come to my home , and i ’ ll wait for you .
i ’ ll do so .
until then , think about the well-being of rome .
well , brutus , you ’ re noble .
caesar resents me , but he loves brutus .
if i were brutus now and brutus were me , i wouldn ’ t have let him influence me .
tonight i ’ ll throw through his window a few letters in different handwriting — as if they came from several citizens — all testifying to the great respect romans have for brutus , and all alluding to caesar ’ s unseemly ambition .
did you accompany caesar home ?
either there are wars in heaven , or else the world , too insolent toward the gods , provokes them to send destruction .
also — i ’ ve kept my sword unsheathed since i saw this — in front of the capitol i met a lion who looked at me and strutted by without bothering to attack me .
and there were a hundred spooked women huddled together in fear who swore they saw men on fire walk up and down the streets .
and yesterday the night owl sat hooting and shrieking in the marketplace at noon .
when all these extraordinary things happen at once , we shouldn ’ t say , “ these happenings can be explained rationally .
they ’ re natural enough . ” i think these things are omens of things to come in our country .
indeed , it ’ s a strange time .
but men tend to interpret things however suits them and totally miss the actual meaning of the things themselves .
is caesar visiting the capitol tomorrow ?
he is , because he told antonius to tell you he ’ d be there tomorrow .
good night then , casca .
this bad weather isn ’ t good to walk around in .
a roman .
it ’ s casca — i know your voice .
your ear is good .
cassius , what a night this is !
it ’ s a very pleasing night to honest men .
who ever saw the heavens threaten like this ?
those who have known how bad things are here on earth .
i have walked around the streets , exposing myself to the perilous night , unbuttoned like this , as you see , casca , baring my chest to the thunderbolt .
when the forked blue lightning seemed to break open the sky , i put myself right where i thought it would hit .
but why did you tempt the heavens like that ?
mankind ’ s role is to fear and tremble when the almighty gods send warning signals .
you ’ re acting stupid , casca , and you lack the quick wits that a roman should have — or else you don ’ t use them .
you go pale , you stare , and you act in awe of the strange disturbance in the heavens .
a man no mightier than you or i in ability , yet grown as huge and frightening as tonight ’ s strange happenings .
let it be who it is .
our tolerance for slavery and oppression shows us to be weak , like women .
indeed , they say that the senators plan to establish caesar as a king tomorrow , and he ’ ll wear his crown at sea and on land everywhere except here in italy .
i know where i ’ ll wear this dagger , then .
i ’ ll kill myself to save myself from slavery .
in suicide , gods make the weak strong .
in suicide , gods allow tyrants to be defeated .
no stony tower , no brass walls , no airless dungeon , no iron chains can contain a strong mind .
but if a man becomes weary of these obstacles , he can always kill himself .
let everyone beware : i can shake off the tyranny that now oppresses me whenever i choose .
so can i.
in fact , every imprisoned man holds in his own hand the tool to free himself .
how can caesar be a tyrant then ?
poor man !
i know he wouldn ’ t be a wolf if the romans didn ’ t act like sheep .
he couldn ’ t be a lion if the romans weren ’ t such easy prey .
people who want to start a big fire quickly start with little twigs .
but , oh no !
what have i said in my grief ?
say no more .
shake my hand .
if you ’ re joining together to right these wrongs , i ’ ll go as far as any one of you .
that ’ s a deal .
now let me tell you , casca , i have already convinced some of the noblest romans to join me in an honorable but dangerous mission .
and i know that by now they ’ re waiting for me on the porch outside pompey ’ s theater .
it ’ s cinna .
i recognize his walk .
to find you .
who ’ s that ?
metellus cimber ?
no , it ’ s casca , someone who ’ s going to work with us .
aren ’ t the others waiting for me , cinna ?
i ’ m glad casca is with us .
what a fearful night this is !
two or three of us have seen strange things .
are the others waiting ?
tell me .
yes , they are .
oh , cassius , if you could only convince brutus to join us — don ’ t worry .
good cinna , take this paper and be sure to lay it in the judge ’ s chair where brutus sits , so he ’ ll find it .
when you ’ ve finished all this , return to the porch of pompey ’ s theater , where you ’ ll find us .
are decius brutus and trebonius there ?
everyone ’ s there except metellus cimber , and he ’ s gone to look for you at your house .
well , i ’ ll hurry and put these papers where you told me .
when you ’ ve finished , go back to pompey ’ s theater .
come on , casca , you and i will go see brutus at his house before sunrise .
yes , you ’ re absolutely right about how worthy brutus is and how much we need him .
let ’ s go , because it ’ s already after midnight , and we want him on our side before daylight .
wake up , i say !
lucius !
did you call me , my lord ?
put a candle in my study , lucius .
call me when it ’ s lit .
i will , my lord .
i have no personal reason to strike at him — only the best interest of the people .
he wants to be crowned .
the question is , how would being king change him ?
evil can come from good , just as poisonous snakes tend to come out into the open on bright sunny days — which means we have to walk carefully .
if we crown him , i have to admit we ’ d be giving him the power to do damage .
cobble you , sir .
you ’ re a cobbler , are you ?
sir , i make my living using an awl .
i ’ m a surgeon to old shoes .
when they ’ re endangered , i save them .
the noblest men who ever walked on leather have walked on my handiwork .
but why aren ’ t you in your shop today ?
why are you leading these men through the streets ?
well , to wear out their shoes and get myself more work .
why would you celebrate it ?
what victory does he bring home ?
what foreign lands has he conquered and captive foreigners chained to his chariot wheels ?
rulers abuse their power when they separate it from compassion .
caesar might act like that .
therefore , in case he does , we must hold him back .
and since our quarrel is with his future behavior , not what he does now , i must frame the argument like this : if his position is furthered , his character will fulfill these predictions .
the candle is burning in your study , sir .
while i was looking for a flint to light it , i found this paper on the window , sealed up like this , and i ’ m sure it wasn ’ t there when i went to bed .
go back to bed .
it isn ’ t daybreak yet .
is tomorrow the 15th of march , boy ?
i don ’ t know , sir .
check the calendar and come tell me .
i will , sir .
sir , fifteen days of march have gone by .
good .
go to the gate .
somebody ’ s knocking .
i haven ’ t slept since cassius first began to turn me against caesar .
is he alone ?
do you know them ?
let them in .
oh , conspiracy , are you ashamed to show your face even at night , when evil things are most free ?
if so , when it ’ s day , where are you going to find a cave dark enough to hide your monstrous face ?
instead , hide your true face behind smiles and friendliness .
i ’ m afraid we ’ re intruding too boldly on your sleep time .
good morning , brutus .
are we bothering you ?
i ’ ve been up all night .
do i know these men who are with you ?
this is trebonius .
he ’ s welcome here .
this is decius brutus .
he ’ s welcome too .
this is casca .
this is cinna .
and this is metellus cimber .
they ’ re all welcome .
what worries have kept you awake tonight ?
can i have a word with you ?
here ’ s the east .
won ’ t the dawn come from here ?
no .
you ’ re both wrong .
and let us swear to our resolution .
no , let ’ s not swear an oath .
then we can let this ambitious tyrant continue unchallenged until each of us is killed at his whim .
but if we have reasons that are strong enough to ignite cowards into action and to make weak women brave — and i think we do — then , countrymen , what else could we possibly need to spur us to action ?
what bond do we need other than that of discreet romans who have said what they ’ re going to do and won ’ t back down ?
and what oath do we need other than that we honest men have told each other that this will happen or we will die trying ?
swearing is for priests , cowards , overly cautious men , feeble old people , and those long-suffering weaklings who welcome abuse .
only men whom you wouldn ’ t trust anyway would swear oaths , and for the worst reasons .
but what about cicero ?
should we see what he thinks ?
i think he will stand strong with us .
let ’ s not leave him out .
no , by no means .
yes , we should get his support , for his mature presence will make others think well of us and speak out in support of our actions .
they ’ ll assume that cicero , with his sound judgment , ordered the actions .
no , don ’ t even mention him .
he ’ ll never follow anything that other men have started .
then leave him out .
indeed , he ’ s not right for this .
good point , decius .
i don ’ t think it would be wise to let mark antony , whom caesar is so fond of , outlive caesar .
we ’ d find that he was a dangerous plotter .
and as you know , his connections , if he put them to good use , might be enough to hurt us all .
our action will seem too bloody if we cut off caesar ’ s head and then hack at his arms and legs too , caius cassius — because mark antony is merely one of caesar ’ s arms .
let ’ s be sacrificers but not butchers , caius .
we ’ re all against what caesar stands for , and there ’ s no blood in that .
oh , how i wish we could oppose caesar ’ s spirit — his overblown ambition — and not hack up caesar himself !
but , unfortunately , caesar has to bleed if we ’ re going to stop him .
noble friends , let ’ s kill him boldly but not with anger .
let ’ s carve him up like a dish fit for the gods , not chop him up like a carcass fit for dogs .
let ’ s be angry only long enough to do the deed , and then let ’ s act like we ’ re disgusted by what we had to do .
this will make our actions seem practical and not vengeful .
if he loves caesar , then he can only hurt himself — by grieving and dying for caesar .
and i ’ d be surprised if he even did that , for he prefers sports , fun , and friends .
there ’ s nothing to fear in him .
quiet !
count how many times the clock chimes .
the clock struck three .
it ’ s time to leave .
it might happen that these strange signs , the unusual terror of this night , and the urgings of his fortune-tellers will keep him away from the capitol today .
don ’ t worry about that .
if he ’ s reluctant , i can convince him .
he loves to hear me tell him how men can be snared by flatterers , just like unicorns can be captured in trees , elephants in holes , and lions with nets .
when i tell him he hates flatterers , he agrees , just at the moment when i ’ m flattering him the most .
let me work on him .
i can put him in the right mood , and i ’ ll bring him to the capitol .
no , we ’ ll all go there to bring him .
by eight o 'clock .
is that the latest we can do it ?
caius ligarius doesn ’ t like caesar , who berated him for speaking well of pompey .
i wonder that none of you thought about getting his support .
good metellus , go to him now .
he likes me , and i ’ ve given him good reason to .
just send him here , and i ’ ll persuade him .
the morning is approaching .
we ’ ll leave , brutus .
friends , go your separate ways .
but all of you , remember what you ’ ve said and prove yourselves true romans .
good gentlemen , look like you ’ re rested and happy .
and so , good morning to all of you .
boy !
lucius !
fast asleep ?
well , enjoy the sweetness of deep sleep .
that ’ s why you sleep so soundly .
brutus , my lord .
portia , what are you doing awake ?
it isn ’ t good for your health to expose your weak body to the raw , cold morning .
it ’ s not good for your health , either .
you rudely snuck out of bed .
and last night at dinner , you got up abruptly and paced back and forth with your arms crossed , brooding and sighing , and when i asked you what was the matter , you gave me a dirty look .
i asked you again , and you scratched your head and stamped your foot impatiently .
i still insisted on knowing what the matter was , but you wouldn ’ t answer me , instead giving me an angry wave of your hand and telling me to leave you alone .
my dear lord , tell me what ’ s bothering you .
and now you toss flowers in the path of caesar , who comes in triumph over pompey ’ s defeated sons ?
go home !
run to your houses , fall on your knees , and pray to the gods to spare you the pain that you deserve for such ingratitude .
go , go , good countrymen , and to make up for having done wrong , gather up all the poor men like yourselves , lead them to the tiber , and weep into the river until it overflows its banks .
you go down toward the capitol , and i ’ ll go this way .
undress the statues if they ’ re decorated in honor of caesar .
can we do that ?
i ’ ll walk around and force the commoners off the streets .
you do the same , wherever the crowds are thick .
if we take away caesar ’ s support , he ’ ll have to come back down to earth ; otherwise , he ’ ll fly too high and keep the rest of us in a state of fear and obedience .
i ’ m not feeling well — that ’ s all .
you ’ re smart , though , and if you were sick , you ’ d take what you needed to get better .
i ’ m doing so .
good portia , go to bed .
are you sick ?
and is it healthy to walk uncovered and breathe in the dampness of the morning ?
you ’ re sick , yet you sneak out of your warm bed and let the humid and disease-infested air make you sicker ?
don ’ t kneel , noble portia .
you ’ re my true and honorable wife , as dear to me as the blood that runs through my sad heart .
if that were true , then i ’ d know your secret .
i admit i ’ m only a woman , but nevertheless i ’ m the woman lord brutus took for his wife .
i admit i ’ m only a woman , but i ’ m still a woman from a noble family — i ’ m cato ’ s daughter .
do you really think i ’ m no stronger than the rest of my sex , with such a father and such a husband ?
tell me your secrets .
i won ’ t betray them .
i ’ ve proved my trustworthiness by giving myself a voluntary wound here in my thigh .
if i can bear that pain , then i can bear my husband ’ s secrets .
oh , gods , make me worthy of this noble wife !
listen !
someone knocks .
leave me quickly .
lucius , who ’ s that knocking ?
here ’ s a sick man who wants to speak with you .
how i wish you felt better !
i ’ m not sick if you ’ ve prepared some honorable exploit for me .
indeed , i would have such an exploit for you , ligarius , if you were healthy enough to hear it .
a deed that will make sick men healthy .
but aren ’ t there some healthy men whom we have to make sick ?
that too .
my dear caius , i ’ ll explain the task at hand to you as we walk toward the man we must do it to .
follow me , then .
neither the sky nor the earth have been quiet tonight .
calphurnia cried out three times in her sleep , “ help , someone !
they ’ re murdering caesar ! ” who ’ s there ?
my lord ?
go tell the priests to perform a sacrifice immediately , and bring me their interpretation of the results .
i will , my lord .
what are you doing , caesar ?
are you planning to go out ?
you ’ re not leaving the house today .
i will go out .
the things that threaten me have only seen my back .
when they see the face of caesar , they will vanish .
caesar , i never believed in omens , but now they frighten me .
a servant told me the night-watchmen saw horrid sights too , but different ones from what we heard and saw .
a lioness gave birth in the streets , and graves cracked open and thrust out their dead .
fierce , fiery warriors fought in the clouds in the usual formations of war — ranks and squadrons — until the clouds drizzled blood onto the capitol .
oh , caesar !
these things are beyond anything we ’ ve seen before , and i ’ m afraid .
how can we avoid what the gods want to happen ?
but i will go out , for these bad omens apply to the world in general as much as they do to me .
when beggars die there are no comets in the sky .
the heavens only announce the deaths of princes .
cowards die many times before their deaths .
the brave experience death only once .
of all the strange things i ’ ve ever heard , it seems most strange to me that men fear death , given that death , which can ’ t be avoided , will come whenever it wants .
what do the priests say ?
they don ’ t want you to go out today .
they pulled out the guts of the sacrificed animal and couldn ’ t find its heart .
the gods do this to test my bravery .
they ’ re saying i ’ d be an animal without a heart if i stayed home today out of fear .
so , i won ’ t .
we ’ re two lions born on the same day in the same litter , and i ’ m the older and more terrible .
i will go out .
alas , my lord , your confidence is getting the better of your wisdom .
don ’ t go out today .
say that it ’ s my fear that keeps you inside and not your own .
we ’ ll send mark antony to the senate house , and he ’ ll say that you ’ re sick today .
mark antony will say i ’ m not well , and to please you i ’ ll stay at home .
here ’ s decius brutus .
he ’ ll tell them so .
hail , caesar !
good morning , worthy caesar .
i ’ ve come to take you to the senate house .
and you ’ ve come at a good time , so you can convey my greetings to the senators and tell them i won ’ t come today .
would i send a lie ?
have i accomplished so much in battle , but now i ’ m afraid to tell some old men the truth ?
decius , go tell them that caesar won ’ t come .
most mighty caesar , give me some reason , so i won ’ t be laughed at when i tell them so .
the reason is that it ’ s what i want .
i ’ m not coming .
that ’ s enough for the senate .
but for your private satisfaction , because i love you , i ’ ll tell you .
calphurnia , my wife , is keeping me at home .
she takes these signs for warnings and predictions of terrible evils to come , and , on her knee , she begged me to stay home today .
this dream has been interpreted all wrong .
it was a good and lucky vision .
your statue spouting blood through many holes , in which many smiling romans bathed , means that you ’ ll provide great rome with sustaining blood , and that great men will strive to get some token of approval from your holy blood .
this is what calphurnia ’ s dream means .
you ’ ve offered an excellent interpretation .
i will have when you hear the rest of what i have to say .
the senate has decided to give mighty caesar a crown today .
if you send them word that you won ’ t come , they might change their minds .
how foolish your fears seem now , calphurnia !
i ’ m ashamed that i yielded to them .
give me my robe , because i ’ m going .
and look , here ’ s publius , come to fetch me .
good morning , caesar .
welcome , publius .
caius ligarius , i was never your enemy so much as the sickness that ’ s made you so thin .
what time is it ?
caesar , the clock has struck eight .
i thank you all for your trouble and courtesy .
and to you , most noble caesar .
i ’ m to blame for making you wait for me .
remember to see me today .
stay near me so i ’ ll remember .
caesar , i will .
good friends , go in and have some wine with me .
and we ’ ll leave together , like friends .
calphurnia !
quiet !
caesar ’ s talking .
calphurnia !
i ’ m here , my lord .
yes , caesar ?
i ’ ll remember .
when caesar says “ do this , ” it is done .
continue , then , and don ’ t forget to perform all of the rituals .
caesar !
caesar , beware of brutus .
watch cassius .
don ’ t go near casca .
keep an eye on cinna .
don ’ t trust trebonius .
pay attention to metellus cimber .
decius brutus doesn ’ t love you .
you ’ ve wronged caius ligarius .
these men all have one intention , and it ’ s directed against caesar .
if you aren ’ t immortal , watch those around you .
a sense of security opens the door to conspiracy .
i pray that the mighty gods defend you !
your friend , artemidorus . ” i ’ ll stand here until caesar passes by , and i ’ ll give him this as though it ’ s a petition .
if you read this , caesar , you might live .
if not , the fates are on the side of the traitors .
boy , i beg you to run to the senate house .
don ’ t stay to answer me — get going .
i want you there and back again before i can even tell you what you should do there .
madam , what should i do ?
run to the capitol and nothing else ?
and then return to you and nothing else ?
yes , return and tell me if your master looks well , because he was sick when he left .
and pay attention to what caesar does and which men are close to him .
listen , boy !
what ’ s that noise ?
i don ’ t hear anything , madam .
i beg you , listen well .
truly , madam , i don ’ t hear anything .
come here , you .
where are you coming from ?
my own house , good lady .
what time is it ?
around nine o 'clock , madam .
has caesar gone to the capital yet ?
madam , not yet .
i ’ m going to stand so i can see him pass on the way to the capitol .
you have some plea for caesar , don ’ t you ?
yes , i do , lady .
if it pleases caesar to be so good to himself as to hear me , i ’ ll try to get him to do what ’ s good for him .
why , do you know of any harm intended toward him ?
nothing that i know for sure , but a lot that i ’ m afraid might happen .
good morning to you .
the street is narrow here .
the crowd that follows caesar at his heels — senators , justices , common petitioners — will suffocate a feeble man almost to death .
i ’ ll move to a more open place and there speak to great caesar as he walks past .
i must go in .
yes , caesar , but it ’ s not gone yet .
oh , caesar , read mine first , for my petition affects you more directly .
read it , great caesar .
whatever pertains to myself i will deal with last .
don ’ t delay , caesar .
read it instantly .
what , is the man insane ?
you have weapons ?
what ’ s going on here ?
stop it , i order you .
the next person to strike again dies .
what ’ s going on here ?
these are the messengers from my sister and the king .
what are you fighting about ?
tell me .
i ’ m out of breath , sir .
a tailor made you .
that ’ s an odd thing to say .
how can a tailor make a person ?
definitely a tailor , sir .
a sculptor or a painter couldn ’ t have screwed him up as bad as that , even as an apprentice .
but tell me what you ’ re fighting about .
calm down .
don ’ t you have any manners , you savage ?
yes , sir , but not when i ’ m enraged .
why are you enraged ?
are you laughing at what i say , as if i were a fool ?
are you insane , old man ?
why are you calling him a jerk ?
what did he do to you ?
i don ’ t like his face .
but maybe you don ’ t like mine , or his , or hers either .
this is a guy who ’ s been praised for his honest bluntness , and who now insolently pretends to be plainspoken and twists the natural meanings of words .
no flattery for him , no sir !
he ’ s honest , he ’ s got to speak the truth .
if people take what he says , fine .
if not , he ’ s got truth on his side !
dearest , kindest , most honorable sir , may i say , with your esteemed approval , which is lit up by the illuminating radiance of the sun-god phoebus , that — what do you mean by that ?
i tried to stop speaking plainly , since you dislike plain speech so much .
sir , i know i ’ m not a flatterer .
i never offended him at all .
these cowards manage to make fools of brave men .
don ’ t put me in the stocks .
i serve the king , who sent me here .
if you put me in the stocks you ’ ll insult him both as a king and as a man .
bring out the stocks !
i swear on my life and honor , he ’ ll sit here in the stocks until noon .
only until noon , my lord ?
no , the whole day , and all night too .
ma 'am , you wouldn ’ t treat me like this if i were your father ’ s dog .
but since you ’ re his scoundrel servant , i will .
this guy is exactly the kind of person your sister warned us about . — come on , bring in the stocks , now !
i beg you not to do this , my lord .
he ’ s done wrong , and his master the king will punish him for it .
the king will be offended to find out that his messenger is so badly treated .
i ’ ll take responsibility for that .
my sister would be much more offended to have her trusted messenger abused and assaulted just for carrying out her orders . — put his legs in the stocks .
i ’ m sorry , my friend .
i ’ ll try talking to him again .
please don ’ t , sir .
even good men have bad luck .
have a good morning .
it ’ s wrong for the duke to do this .
the king will be angry with him .
honor you .
hopefully when i get married , i ’ ll give my husband half my love and half my sense of duty .
i ’ m sure i ’ ll never get married in the way my sisters say they ’ re married , loving their father only .
but do you mean what you ’ re saying ?
yes , my lord .
so young and so cruel ?
so young , my lord , and honest .
then that ’ s the way it ’ ll be .
the truth will be all the inheritance you get .
foreign savages who eat their own children for dinner will be as close to my heart as you , ex-daughter of mine .
but sir — be quiet , kent .
i heard myself declared an outlaw and escaped capture by hiding in the trunk of a hollow tree .
every town and port is crawling with henchmen on the lookout , waiting to capture me .
i ’ ll smear my face with filth , put on a loincloth , make my hair matted and tangled , and face the bad weather wearing almost nothing .
well , at least that ’ s something .
as edgar , i ’ m nothing at all .
it ’ s strange that regan and her husband left their house without sending back my messenger .
according to what i heard , they had no travel plans as of last night .
what ’ s this ?
are you sitting around in this humiliation to amuse yourself ?
no , my lord .
ha , ha !
that ’ s a nasty garter belt .
you tie up horses by their heads , dogs and bears by their necks , monkeys by their waists , and humans by their legs .
your daughter and son-in-law .
no .
yes .
no , no , they wouldn ’ t .
yes , they have .
by the god jupiter above , i swear “ no . ” by jupiter ’ s wife juno , i swear “ yes . ” they wouldn ’ t dare .
they couldn ’ t , they wouldn ’ t .
it ’ s worse than murder to humiliate a king ’ s messenger like this .
my lord , when i arrived at their home i gave them your letter .
he woke up the whole house with his loud and cowardly screams .
that ’ s why your daughter and son-in-law are punishing me shamefully .
fathers who wear rags make their children neglect them .
but fathers who are rich make their children kind .
lady luck is a fickle whore and never gives the poor a break .
but despite all this , your daughters will give you a lot of money — or do i mean pain ? — in the coming year .
i feel my stomach squeezing up against my heart .
inside , sir , with the earl .
don ’ t follow me .
stay here .
you didn ’ t do anything else to earn this punishment ?
nothing .
tell me , why did the king arrive with such a small entourage ?
if they ’ d put you in the stocks for asking that question , you would ’ ve deserved it .
why , fool ?
you need to learn what ants know well about winter — there ’ s no point in slaving away if there ’ s no hope for profit .
everyone can see that , and even blind men can smell the stench of his misery now .
when you see a huge wheel rolling down a hill , you shouldn ’ t try to hold on to it or it ’ ll break your neck .
but if you see a wheel going uphill , latch on for the ride .
and when a wise man gives you better advice than i just did , give me my advice back again .
i only want idiots following my advice , the advice of a fool .
the gentleman who serves you only for profit and is only superficially loyal to you will take off when it starts to rain and leave you alone in the storm .
but i ’ ll linger .
the fool will stay .
and let the wise man run away .
where did you learn that song , fool ?
not in the stocks , fool .
how can they refuse to speak with me ?
they ’ re playing with me .
these are tricks .
this is rebellion .
my dear lord , you know how passionately stubborn the duke is .
damn it all to hell !
passionately ” ?
what “ passion ” ?
gloucester , gloucester , i want to speak with the duke of cornwall and his wife .
my lord , i informed them as much .
informed them ” ?
do you understand what i ’ m saying , man ?
yes , my lord .
the king wants to speak with cornwall .
did you inform them of that ?
this is unbelievable !
passionate ” ?
the “ passionate ” duke ?
tell the hot-headed duke that i … but no , not yet .
maybe he ’ s not feeling well .
i just want everything to be all right between you .
oh , my heart , my heart is rising into my throat !
stay down , heart .
that ’ s right , uncle , talk to your heart , like the good morning to you both .
hail to your majesty .
i ’ m glad to see your highness .
i believe you are , regan .
you know why i think so ?
my dear regan , your sister ’ s not worth anything .
oh , regan , she ’ s torn me apart with unkindness , like a vulture , right here .
calm down , sir , please .
how do you mean ?
i can ’ t believe my sister would neglect her obligations in any way .
if she restrained your rowdy knights , she had such a good reason that you can ’ t blame her for it .
i curse her .
sir , you ’ re old .
your life is stretched to its limit .
you should let others take care of you and submit to people who know better than you do what ’ s good for you .
please go back to goneril ’ s house .
admit you were wrong .
apologize ?
no more , please .
these are ugly antics .
go back to my sister ’ s .
shush , sir , please !
i hope lightning strikes her in the eyes !
i hope poisonous swampy fog covers her face and ruins her complexion !
oh , dear gods !
that ’ s how you ’ ll talk about me when you ’ re in this mood .
her eyes are vicious , but yours are comforting .
you haven ’ t forgotten the half of a kingdom i gave you .
sir , let ’ s get to the point .
get out of my sight ! — i guess if she doesn ’ t love her father , then i ’ ll only have peace when i ’ m dead . — call the king of france .
call the duke of burgundy .
if she wants to be proud , or “ honest , ” as she calls it , she can just marry her own pride .
king lear , i ’ ve always honored you as king , loved you as my father , obeyed you as my master , and thanked you in my prayers — i ’ m furious and ready to snap .
let your anger fall on me then , even if its sharpness pierces my heart .
kent can speak rudely when lear goes mad .
what are you doing , old man ?
when powerful kings cave in to flatterers , do you think loyal men will be afraid to speak out against it ?
when a majestic king starts acting silly , then it ’ s my duty to be blunt .
what ’ s that trumpet ?
i know it .
she ’ ll be here soon , just like her letter said .
this is a lowlife who basks in the reflection of the fading glory of the woman he works for . — get out of my sight , scoundrel !
what do you mean , your highness ?
who put my servant in the stocks ?
regan , i hope you didn ’ t know anything about that . — ah , who ’ s this ?
why shouldn ’ t she take my hand , father ?
how exactly have i offended you ?
i sent him there , sir , but his crimes deserved a worse punishment .
you !
you did it ?
please , father , since you ’ re weak , act like it .
get rid of half your knights and go back to spend the rest of your month with my sister .
right now i ’ m away from home and i can ’ t provide you with proper care .
go back with her ?
go back with her ?
i might as well go before the king of france , who took my youngest daughter without a dowry , kneel before his throne , and beg him to give me a tiny pension to stay alive .
go back with her ?
i ’ d rather be a slave or a packhorse for this hateful stablehand here .
as you wish , sir .
i beg you , daughter , don ’ t make me crazy .
i won ’ t bother you .
we ’ ll never see each other again .
but you ’ re still my child , my flesh and blood — or rather you ’ re a disease in my flesh , a disease i still have to call my own .
you ’ re a pustule , a sore , a tumor digesting my bloodline .
but i ’ ll stop rebuking you .
i won ’ t beg the gods to punish you , or caution you to fear their judgment .
become a better
person when you ’ re ready , if you ’ re inclined .
i ’ ll wait patiently .
meanwhile i ’ ll stay with regan with my hundred knights .
it ’ s not quite that simple .
i wasn ’ t expecting you , and i ’ m not ready to receive you .
please hear what goneril is saying .
we ’ re trying to be reasonable while you ’ re so upset , and we understand that you ’ re old , and … but goneril knows what she ’ s doing .
yes , i do .
how could so many people , under two masters , get along under one roof ?
it would be hard , almost impossible .
why couldn ’ t you be attended by my servants , or by regan ’ s ?
yes , why not , my lord ?
then if they ’ re negligent , we could control them .
now that i think about the danger of these knights , if you come to stay with me , please bring no more than twenty-five of them with you .
i won ’ t lodge any more than that under my roof .
i gave you everything — and it was about time too .
i made you de facto rulers of my kingdom on condition that i could keep a hundred knights of my own .
why should i now have to make do with only twenty-five ?
regan , is that what you said ?
yes , i ’ ll say it again , my lord .
no more than twenty-five .
not being the worst daughter deserves some praise , i guess .
hear me out , my lord .
why do you need twenty-five knights , or ten , or even five , when you ’ re staying in a house with a staff of double that at your service ?
why do you need even one ?
oh , don ’ t ask me why i “ need ” them !
you ’ re a well-dressed lady .
if you dressed only to stay warm , you wouldn ’ t need these gorgeous clothes you ’ re wearing — which don ’ t keep you warm at all .
oh , gods , give me patience !
you see me here , gods , a grieving old man , as wretched in his grief as he is in his old age .
if you ’ re the ones setting my daughters against me , don ’ t let me be foolish enough to take it lying down .
man ’ s cheeks .
no , you monstrous hags , i ’ ll get revenge on you both that will make the whole world … i will do such things — i don ’ t know what i ’ ll do exactly , but it ’ ll be devastating .
you expect me to cry ?
well , i won ’ t .
i have a good reason to cry , but my heart will splinter into a hundred thousand pieces before i let myself cry . — oh , fool , i ’ ll go mad !
let ’ s go inside .
there ’ s going to be a storm .
this is a small house .
there ’ s no room for the old man and his followers .
it ’ s his fault that he ’ s all worked up like this .
he has to pay the price for his foolish actions .
that ’ s what i intend to do too .
where is gloucester ?
he followed the old man .
here he comes back .
where ’ s he going ?
he has called for his horse , but i don ’ t know where he ’ s headed .
it ’ s best just to let him go .
he won ’ t listen to anyone ’ s advice .
there ’ s hardly a bush for miles around .
oh , sir , impetuous people learn their lessons from the consequences of their foolish actions .
lock the doors .
his attendants are desperate , violent men .
i ’ m afraid of what they might encourage him to do , considering the state he ’ s in .
lock the doors , my lord .
it ’ s a wild night .
regan gives good advice .
come in out of the storm .
who ’ s there , aside from this foul weather ?
someone whose mood is as foul as the weather , very troubled .
i know you .
where ’ s the king ?
struggling with the wind and rain .
he ’ s shouting at the wind to blow the earth into the sea , or make the sea flood the earth — he wants to see the world return to primal chaos .
he keeps tearing out his white hair , which the blindly raging winds catch up and blow away into nothingness .
small but brave in his surroundings , he ’ s trying to stand up against the wind and rain blowing back and forth .
he ’ s running bareheaded , calling for the end of the world , out there on a night like this , when even savage animals ravenous with hunger crawl under cover and hide .
but who ’ s with him ?
nobody but the fool , who ’ s trying to soothe the wounds in the king ’ s heart with jokes .
sir , i know you , and i trust you enough to share something very important with you .
some french agents are already at work in our main ports and are on the verge of declaring open war .
now this is where you come in .
i ’ m a nobleman , and i know what i ’ m doing in assigning this job to you .
let ’ s discuss it some more .
let me shake your hand .
do you have anything else to tell me ?
rage on , blow !
let tornadoes spew water until the steeples of our churches and the weathervanes are all drowned .
let quick sulfurous lightning , strong enough to split enormous trees , singe the white hair on my head .
let thunder flatten the spherical world , crack open all the molds from which nature forms human beings , and spill all the seeds from which ungrateful humans grow !
oh , uncle , it ’ s better to smile and flatter indoors where it ’ s dry than get soaked out here .
please , uncle , let ’ s go in and ask your daughters to forgive you .
this storm has no pity for either wise men or fools .
let thunder rumble !
let lightning spit fire !
let the rain spray !
the rain , the wind , the thunder and lightning are not my daughters .
nature , i don ’ t accuse your weather of unkindness .
so go ahead and have your terrifying fun .
here i am , your slave — a poor , sick , weak , hated old man .
anyone who has a house to cover his head has a good head on his shoulders .
on my life i swear to you that your youngest daughter doesn ’ t love you least .
kent , if you want to stay alive , stop talking .
get out of my sight !
learn to see better , lear , and let me stay here where you can look to me for good advice .
now , i swear by apollo … by apollo , king , you ’ re taking the names of the gods in vain .
oh , you lowlife !
scum !
please stop , sir .
listen to me , you traitor .
for there never was a pretty woman who didn ’ t like to preen in the mirror .
no , i ’ ll be patient .
i won ’ t say a word .
who ’ s there ?
a wise man and a fool .
let the gods who stirred up this dreadful storm bring their enemies to light .
it will give you some protection from this storm .
they are harder than the stones the house is made of .
i ’ m starting to lose my mind .
that ’ s true , my good boy . — come on , take us to that hut .
i ’ ll recite a prophecy before i go .
and whoever lives to see that day will walk with his feet .
this is the prophecy that the wizard
oh , oh , edmund , i don ’ t like this monstrous business .
when asked the duke and duchess of cornwall if i could take pity on the king and shelter him from the storm , they took my house away from me and ordered me never to talk about him , lobby for him , or support him in any way .
that ’ s uncivilized and unnatural !
oh , be quiet .
there ’ s a feud between the two dukes .
it ’ s dangerous to talk about it .
i ’ ve locked it up in my room .
the humiliation that the king is suffering now will be revenged thoroughly .
armed forces have already landed .
we have to take the king ’ s side .
i ’ ll look for him and secretly help him .
you go and talk to the duke so he won ’ t notice i ’ m helping the king .
if he asks to see me , tell him i ’ m sick and went to bed .
even if i have to die — as they threaten — i have to help the king .
strange things are about to happen , edmund .
please be careful .
and i ’ ll tell him about the letter too .
the young generation rises while the old one falls .
here ’ s the hut , my lord .
please go inside .
the night ’ s too rough for humans to bear .
leave me for a bit .
my lord , here is the entrance .
will you break my heart ?
i ’ d rather break my own heart .
now please go in .
you think it ’ s a big deal that this fierce storm is soaking me to the skin .
it ’ s a big deal to you .
but whenever you feel a larger pain , the smaller one disappears .
you would run away from a bear , but if the only way to run was into the stormy ocean , you ’ d turn around and confront the bear .
when your mind is at peace , your body is sensitive to the elements .
but this storm in my mind keeps me from feeling anything except what ’ s tormenting me — how ungrateful my children are !
isn ’ t their ingratitude like the mouth biting the hand that feeds it ?
but i ’ ll punish them thoroughly .
no , i won ’ t cry any more .
imagine them locking me out on a night like this !
but let it rain ; i ’ ll survive .
on a night like this !
oh , regan , goneril , your kind old father whose generous heart gave you everything — oh , if i think about that i ’ ll go mad .
i want to avoid that .
no more of these thoughts .
my lord , please go inside here .
go inside yourself .
make yourself comfortable .
this storm protects me from thoughts that would hurt me more .
but i ’ ll go in .
go out and feel what the impoverished feel .
don ’ t come in here , uncle !
there ’ s a spirit in here !
help me , help me !
give me your hand .
who ’ s there ?
a ghost , a ghost !
he says his name ’ s poor tom .
who are you , moaning in the hut like that ?
come out .
go away !
the devil ’ s after me !
the cold wind blows through the hawthorn trees .
ha !
get into your cold beds and warm yourselves up .
did you give everything to your two daughters and end up like this ?
bless your five senses !
tom ’ s chilly .
oh do-de , do-de , do-de .
god protect you from tornadoes , evil stars , and diseases !
take pity on poor tom , who is persecuted by the devil .
there ! … and over there ! … and over there !
have his daughters made him crazy like this ? — couldn ’ t you have kept something for yourself ?
did you have to give them everything ?
if he hadn ’ t , we ’ d all be embarrassed to look at him .
then may your daughters be cursed with all the horrible fates that await sinners !
he doesn ’ t have any daughters , sir .
like hell !
nothing but cruel daughters could have degraded him like this .
is it fashionable now for neglected fathers to get so little pity ?
i ’ m the one who fathered those bloodsucking daughters .
this stormy night will turn us all into fools and madmen .
beware of the devil .
obey your parents , keep your word , don ’ t swear , don ’ t sleep with another man ’ s wife , and don ’ t covet flashy clothes .
tom ’ s chilly .
what were you before this ?
i loved wine and gambling , and had more women than a turkish sultan keeps in his harem .
the cold wind ’ s still blowing through the hawthorn tree .
look at him .
the human being unburdened by the trappings of civilization is no more than a poor , naked , two-legged animal like you .
let me unbutton this .
please calm down , uncle .
this is a nasty night to go swimming .
on a night like this a campfire in an empty field would be like the heart of a dirty old man — a tiny spark in a cold body .
look , here comes a walking fire .
this is the devil flibbertigibbet .
he gets up at nightfall and wanders around till dawn .
and go away , witch , go away .
how are you , your highness ?
who are you ?
what do you want ?
who are you ?
what are your names ?
calm down , smulkin , you fiend !
he ’ s called modo and mahu .
poor tom ’ s chilly .
come back to my house with me .
i couldn ’ t bear to obey all of your daughters ' harsh orders .
they commanded me to lock my doors and leave you out in this merciless storm , but i ’ ve come out here to find you and take you where there ’ s warmth and food .
first let me talk with this philosopher here . —
now get out of here !
i swear by jupiter i ’ ll never revoke this punishment .
farewell , king .
here are the rulers of france and burgundy , my lord .
my lord the ruler of burgundy , i ’ ll speak to you first .
you ’ ve been competing with this king for my daughter .
let me ask you something in private .
can you blame him ?
his daughters want to kill him .
ah , good old kent said this would happen — that poor , banished man .
you say the king is losing his mind .
let me tell you , my friend , i ’ m almost insane myself .
i had a son , whom i ’ ve legally disowned .
he tried to kill me recently , very recently .
i loved him , as much as any father ever loved his son .
what a storm !
excuse me , sir . — tom ’ s chilly .
stay warm .
come on , let ’ s all go inside .
this way , my lord .
come on , my dear greek philosopher .
i ’ ll get my revenge before i leave this house .
i ’ m afraid to think how i ’ ll be criticized for letting my natural affection for my father give way to my loyalty to you .
now i realize your brother tried to kill your father not just because your brother is an evil man , but because your father deserved it by being wicked himself .
how unlucky am i , having to apologize for doing the right thing !
come with me to see the duchess .
if this letter ’ s right , you ’ ve got a lot to deal with .
right or not , it ’ s made you the earl of gloucester .
i put my trust in you .
it ’ s better here than outside .
be happy about it .
i ’ ll do what i can to make you even more comfortable .
i won ’ t be gone long .
he can ’ t bear his grief and so he ’ s losing his mind .
may god reward you for your kindness !
he ’ s a king , a king !
no , he ’ s an ordinary guy who ’ s got a gentleman for a son , since someone would have to be crazy to let his son become a gentleman before he ’ s achieved that distinction himself .
i see regan and goneril in hell — a thousand hissing devils with sizzling red pitchforks come up to them !
the nasty devil ’ s biting my butt .
i ’ ll do it .
the devil sings like a nightingale to haunt poor tom .
the demon hoppedance is in tom ’ s belly , crying for some fish to eat .
stop whining , devil .
i ’ ve got no food to give you .
let ’ s have the evidence .
let ’ s give a fair verdict .
there she is .
come here , ma 'am .
is your name goneril ?
she can ’ t deny it .
and here ’ s regan , whose grotesque face betrays her twisted heart .
stop her !
fire !
you corrupt judge , why did you let her escape ?
bless your heart .
look at the three little dogs , tray , blanch , and sweetheart — all barking at me .
tom will chase them off . — go away , you mongrels !
whether you bite to kill , mastiff , greyhound , or ugly mutt ,
hound or spaniel , bitch or dog , whether your tail is short or curly — tom will make you cry and wail .
with one little toss of his head , he can scare you off for good .
whether your mouth is black or white , do-dee , dee-dee da .
stop !
run off , go visit fairs and festivals !
poor tom , your cup is empty .
is there any natural cause for hardening of the heart ?
please lie down and rest a while , my lord .
be quiet , be quiet .
draw the curtains , just like that .
we ’ ll have supper in the morning .
that ’ s right .
and i ’ ll go to bed at noon .
he ’ s here , sir , but please don ’ t bother him .
he ’ s out of his right mind .
please get him , my friend , i beg you .
put
carry your master out .
come on , come on .
when we see that our betters have the same problems we do , we can almost forget our own misery .
the person who suffers alone suffers the most .
companions in sorrow alleviate our grief .
let ’ s go , tom .
whatever else happens tonight , i hope the king escapes safely !
lurk out of sight .
hang him immediately .
gouge out his eyes !
leave him to my wrath . — edmund , go with my sister-in-law .
you shouldn ’ t have to see the punishment we inflict on your father .
tell the duke of albany to prepare for war immediately .
we will do the same .
we ’ ll keep the lines of communication open between us .
hello .
where ’ s the king ?
lord gloucester has helped him leave .
thirty-five or thirty-six of his knights met him at the gate , and together with some others they ’ ve set off for dover , where they claim to have powerful friends .
prepare the horses for your lady .
goodbye , my sweet lord . — goodbye , my sister .
goodbye , edmund .
go find the traitor gloucester .
tie him up like a thief and bring him here to me .
that ’ s him .
tie up his withered old arms .
what are you doing ?
my friends , remember that you ’ re my guests here .
don ’ t play any nasty tricks on me .
tie him up , i tell you .
your highness , i want nothing more than what you ’ ve already offered .
i know you ’ ll offer nothing less than that .
there she is , over there .
i don ’ t know what to say .
so do you take her or leave her ?
then leave her , sir .
tie him up harder . — you filthy traitor !
i ’ m not a traitor , unfair lady .
tie him to this chair . — you ’ ll see , criminal — by the gods , it ’ s disgraceful for you to pull my beard .
as old and white-haired as you are , and you ’ re such a traitor ?
wicked woman , these white hairs you ’ re pulling off my chin will come to life and accuse you of wrong-doing .
you are my guests .
this is no way to treat a host who has welcomed you into his house .
what do you think you ’ re doing ?
tell us about the letters that you got from france .
get to the point , since we already know the truth .
and what ’ s your connection with the traitors who landed in our kingdom recently ?
the ones you ’ ve sent our lunatic king to .
tell us .
it came from a neutral party , not from someone opposed to you .
how clever of you .
clever lies .
where have you sent the king ?
to dover .
why dover ?
weren ’ t you ordered , on penalty of — why dover ? — let him answer that question first .
i ’ m backed into a corner with nowhere to run .
why dover ?
because i didn ’ t want to watch while you gouged out his poor old eyes with your cruel fingernails , or while your vicious sister sank her fangs into his sacred flesh .
you left him out in the storm in the black night , bareheaded , a storm so terrible that if it had happened at sea , the waters would have risen up and extinguished the fire burning in the stars .
and the poor old man just wept , mixing his tears with the rain .
if wolves had been howling outside your gate at the heart of that storm , you would ’ ve told your doorman to let them in , despite all the cruelties you inflict on the world .
but soon i ’ ll see the gods punish you for your lack of respect to your father .
you won ’ t be seeing anything . — hold his chair still , men . — i ’ m going to put my foot on his eyes .
oh , help me , anyone who wants to live long !
oh , so cruel !
oh dear gods !
now he ’ s a little crooked .
i ’ ve served you since childhood , but i ’ ve never done you a better service than telling you to stop .
what ’ s this , you dog ?
i am willing to fight you if i must .
what do you mean by all this ?
come on then .
i am dying ! — my lord , you still have one eye left to see cornwall punished .
oh !
where ’ s your sparkle now ?
where ’ s my son edmund ?
wrong , evil traitor .
you ’ re appealing to a son who hates you .
he ’ s too good to have any compassion for you .
what a fool i ’ ve been !
this means i ’ ve mistreated edgar .
he can sniff his way to dover .
i ’ m wounded .
follow me , madam . — throw the blind traitor outside .
and throw this dead peasant into the manure pit . — regan , i ’ m bleeding .
it ’ s a bad time for such an injury .
give me your arm .
if our criminal master gets off free , i won ’ t care what happens to me anymore .
if she lives a long and happy life , then all women may as well turn into monsters .
let ’ s follow the old earl , and get that crazy tom to take him wherever he wants to go .
as a wandering lunatic , he can do whatever he wants .
go ahead .
i ’ ll get some cloth and egg whites to bandage his bleeding face .
heaven help him !
at the bottom , any change is for the better .
so i welcome this wind freely .
but who is this ?
my father , led by a poor peasant ?
oh , life is full of surprises !
we age and die because they wear us out .
i ’ ve rented land from you and your father for eighty years .
away , get out of here .
leave me , my friend .
but you can ’ t see where you ’ re going , sir .
i don ’ t have anywhere to go , so i don ’ t need to see .
when i could see , i didn ’ t always see clearly .
it ’ s often the case that having something makes us spoiled , while not having it turns out to be advantageous .
if i live long enough to touch you again , that would be as good as having my eyesight back .
who ’ s that ?
who ’ s there ?
is it a beggar ?
i was reminded of my son , even though i despised my son at that time .
now i know better .
is that the naked guy ?
yes , my lord .
but sir , he ’ s crazy .
it ’ s the tragedy of our times that lunatics must lead the blind .
do as i asked you .
or rather , do what you feel like doing .
hey , naked guy — poor tom ’ s chilly .
come here , man .
do you know the way to dover ?
poor tom has been scared out of his mind .
bless you , master .
yes , sir .
there ’ s a cliff there that leans precariously over the deep sea .
take me to the edge of it , and i ’ ll reward all your troubles with something valuable .
once i ’ m there , i won ’ t need a guide anymore .
give me your arm .
poor tom will take you there .
welcome , my lord .
i ’ m surprised my bland husband didn ’ t meet me on the way here .
where ’ s your master ?
but it ’ d take a miracle to make me believe she could do anything that horrible .
enough .
it would ’ ve been better for you not to have been born at all than to displease me as you did .
you mean this is the whole problem , that she is shy and hasn ’ t said everything she means to say and do ? — my lord of burgundy , what do you have to say to this lady ?
love ’ s not love when it gets mixed up with irrelevant outside matters .
will you marry her ?
she herself is as valuable as any dowry could ever be .
i ’ m at your service until death .
my dear gloucester !
what a man ! — especially compared to my husband .
edmund , you deserve me to be your woman .
there ’ s a fool sharing my bed now .
ma 'am , my master ’ s coming .
so you finally find me worthy of your attentions .
goneril , you aren ’ t worth the dust the wind blows in your face .
i don ’ t trust you .
you can ’ t trust anyone who abuses her own father , her flesh and blood .
she will wither and come to a bad end .
oh , shut up .
your words are idiotic .
bad people can ’ t appreciate wisdom or goodness .
they only like things as bad as themselves .
what have you two sisters done ?
you ’ re tigers , not daughters .
could my good brother-in-law — a man to whom the
coward !
shame on you , warped hag !
your true demonic features are distorting your body .
if i let myself do what i yearn to , i ’ d rip the flesh off your bones .
but i won ’ t attack a woman , even if she is a demon .
i sneeze on your manhood .
what news do you bring ?
gloucester ’ s eyes ?
there ’ s justice in heaven after all !
that these crimes are punished so quickly is proof .
but oh , poor glou-cester !
did he lose his other eye ?
he lost both , my lord . — ma 'am , this letter is from your sister , and needs an immediate answer .
he was on his way here with your wife .
but he isn ’ t here now .
no , my lord .
yes , my lord .
he was the one who denounced his father .
what else you do know ?
do you know why the king of france suddenly went back home ?
it was urgent and important enough to require his personal presence .
whom did he leave in charge here ?
the marshal of france , monsieur la far .
was queen cordelia aggrieved by the letters you delivered ?
yes , sir .
she seemed to be trying to control her emotions , which were overwhelming her .
so she was moved by it ?
if everyone looked so lovely in their sorrow , then sorrow would be highly prized .
she didn ’ t ask anything ?
actually , once or twice she sighed and said , “ father , ” as if the word were pressing on her chest .
once she exclaimed , “ sisters , sisters , shame on you !
kent , father , sisters !
what , out in a storm in the middle of the night ?
i can ’ t believe it . ” the tears fell from her eyes like holy water .
then she ran away to grieve alone .
have you not spoken to her since then ?
no .
did this happen before the king of france returned home ?
no , afterward .
why , good sir ?
he ’ s too overwhelmed with shame .
he remembers how unkind he was to her , how he disowned her and sent her abroad , how he gave her rightful inheritance to her two dog-hearted sisters .
all those memories pain his mind so deeply that guilt and shame keep him away from cordelia .
oh , the poor man !
have you heard about albany ’ s and cornwall ’ s troops ?
i have .
they ’ re on the march .
well , sir , i ’ ll take you to lear and have you stay with him a while .
i have important business that requires me to remain in disguise a while longer .
when i ’ ve revealed my true identity , you ’ ll be glad you took the time to help me out .
please come with me .
sadly , it ’ s the king that ’ s missing .
search high and low , in every acre of the fields , and bring him here for me to see him .
there is a way , ma 'am .
but there are many herbs that will help him rest and take his mind off his anguish for a while .
then i ’ ll water all those precious herbs with my tears to make them grow .
may they relieve a sick old man ’ s suffering .
go find those herbs for him , before his madness puts his life in danger .
i have news , ma 'am .
the british forces are on their way here .
we already knew that .
our forces are ready for them .
oh , father , i ’ m taking care of your business .
that ’ s why the king of france listened to my pleas and tears .
we ’ re not invading england out of ambition or greed , but out of love — dear love ! — and my father ’ s right to his kingdom .
i hope i see him and hear him again soon .
have my brother-in-law ’ s troops been mobilized ?
yes , ma 'am .
is he there in person ?
yes , making a big fuss .
your sister ’ s the better soldier of the two .
lord edmund didn ’ t speak to your master at home ?
no , ma 'am .
what could my sister ’ s letter to him say ?
i don ’ t know , ma 'am .
he rushed away on serious business .
it was a huge mistake to let old gloucester live after we blinded him .
wherever he goes , he inspires compassion and people turn against us .
and also to find out the size of the enemy army .
i have to follow him and give him the letter .
our troops are deployed tomorrow .
stay with us tonight .
it ’ s dangerous out there .
peace to you , my lord of burgundy .
since you love money and power so much , i won ’ t be your wife .
i ’ ll take you and your wonderful virtues here and now , if it ’ s okay that i ’ m picking up what others have thrown away .
no duke of spineless burgundy can take this treasure of a girl from me now . — say goodbye to them , cordelia , even though they ’ ve been unkind to you .
she ’ s no longer my daughter , and i ’ ll never see her face again .
say goodbye to your sisters .
i can ’ t , ma 'am .
my lady ordered me to deliver her letter .
why would she write to edmund ?
it probably has something to do with … i don ’ t know .
ma 'am , i ’ d rather — i know your lady goneril doesn ’ t love her husband .
i ’ m sure of that .
and when she was here recently she flirted with edmund and gave him significant glances .
i know she trusts you and tells you everything .
me , ma 'am ?
i know what i ’ m talking about .
so i recommend you take note of what i ’ m about to say .
my husband is dead .
edmund and i have talked , and it makes more sense for him to marry me than goneril .
you can figure out the rest .
goodbye .
when will we get to the top of that cliff ?
the ground feels flat to me .
no , it ’ s dreadfully steep .
no , really , i don ’ t .
then your other senses must be getting worse because of the trauma of blindness .
it may be so .
it seems to me that your voice has changed , and that your speech is more elegant than it used to be .
you ’ re mistaken about all that .
the only thing different about me is my clothes .
i think you ’ re more articulate .
come on , sir .
this is the place .
stand still .
it ’ s so scary to look down !
the crows flying down below look as small as ants .
halfway down the cliff there ’ s somebody clinging to the rock and gathering wild herbs — a risky business !
that big ship over there looks no bigger
up here you can ’ t even hear the waves crashing against the rocks .
lead me to where you ’ re standing .
give me your hand .
you ’ re now within a foot of the cliff ’ s edge .
let go of my hand .
goodbye , good sir .
with all my heart .
oh , you mighty gods !
gone , sir .
goodbye .
go away and let me die .
you just fell the height of ten ship masts , straight down .
it ’ s a miracle you ’ re alive .
say something again .
but did i fall or not ?
you fell from the terrifying top of this chalk cliff .
look for yourself — see the top of the cliff way up there ?
the lark shrilly singing up there is too far away to be heard .
just look .
it used to be the last ditch comfort of miserable people .
give me your arm .
get up .
how do you feel ?
can you feel your legs ?
you ’ re standing .
only too well .
this is beyond weird .
what was that thing i saw moving away from you up on the cliff before you fell ?
that was a poor unlucky beggar .
from down here , i thought his eyes looked like full moons .
he had a thousand noses and twisted horns , like wave crests in a storm at sea .
it was some devil .
i understand now .
from now on i ’ ll put up with my anguish until the anguish itself cries out , “ enough , enough ! ” and disappears .
i thought that thing you ’ re talking about was a man .
cheer up and be at peace .
but who is that ?
i ’ m the king himself .
life ’ s better at
piece of cheese will get him . — i challenge you to a match .
oh , that arrow was well shot .
whoosh !
sweet marjoram .
that ’ s it !
i know that voice .
ha !
goneril with a white beard ?
i tell you , they are not honest men .
they told me i was everything .
i recognize something about that voice .
isn ’ t that the king ?
yes , every inch a king .
i pardon that man .
what are you accused of ?
adultery ?
i ’ ll commute your death sentence .
to die for adultery ?
no .
little birds do it , and dragonflies copulate right in front of me .
let ’ s have more sex in the world , since gloucester ’ s bastard son was kinder to him than my daughters , conceived in lawful wedlock , have been to me .
get to it , be lustful , sleep around — i need soldiers for my army .
women are sex machines below the waist , though they ’ re chaste up above .
that ’ s where hell is , and darkness , and fires and stench !
give me an aphrodisiac , pharmacist .
there ’ s money in it for you .
oh , let me kiss his hand !
let me wipe it off first .
i remember your eyes quite well .
are you squinting at me ?
read it .
how ?
with my eye sockets ?
oh ho , is that what you ’ re getting at ?
no eyes in your head til there ’ s money in your wallet ?
what , are you crazy ?
you don ’ t need eyes to see how the world works .
look with your ears .
look how the judge yells at a simple thief .
have you seen a farmer ’ s dog bark at a beggar ?
yes , sir .
and you saw how the beggar ran from the mutt ?
that ’ s authority !
you stupid cop , stop your violence !
why are you whipping that whore ?
you should be whipping yourself , since you lust after her and yearn to do the same thing for which you ’ re punishing her .
one criminal punishes another .
you can ’ t blame anyone for it anyone , i say .
i ’ ll vouch for that .
believe me , my friend , since i have the power to stop the prosecutors .
harder , harder .
like that .
if you want to cry over my bad luck , i ’ ll give you my eyes .
i know you .
your name ’ s gloucester .
you have to be patient with me .
i came here crying .
the first time we see the world as newborns , we cry and scream .
i ’ ll read you a sermon .
listen to this .
oh , how awful !
when we ’ re born , we cry because we ’ ve arrived on the stage of life , like all the other fools .
that ’ s a nice hat you ’ ve got there .
how ingenious to make horseshoes out of felt .
i ’ ll test it out .
and when i ’ ve sneaked up on my sons-in-law , then i ’ ll kill , kill , kill , kill , kill , kill !
what , i ’ m a prisoner ?
no rescue for me ?
treat me well .
there ’ s a ransom .
i need a doctor .
my brains are injured .
you can have anything you want .
will no one back me up ?
am i all alone ?
that would make anyone cry enough to water his garden with his tears .
good sir —
i ’ ll die you ’ re of royal blood , and we obey you .
then there ’ s still a chance .
come and get it !
but you ’ ll have to catch me !
catch me if you can !
sa , sa , sa , sa .
in a king , the sight is unbearable .
hello , good sir .
how do you do , sir .
how can i help you ?
have you heard any news of impending battle ?
certainly .
everyone who can hear has heard about it .
could you tell me how near the enemy is ?
very near , and approaching fast .
the main body of the army is expected here any hour now .
thank you , sir .
that ’ s all i wanted to know .
i know you for what you really are , but as your sister i ’ m reluctant to criticize you .
i leave him in your care — but oh , if only i were still in his favor i could arrange for better care for him .
goodbye to you both .
don ’ t tell us what our duty is .
time will tell what you ’ ve got up your sleeve .
have a good life .
come with me , my dear cordelia .
sister , i have a lot to say about things that concern us both .
i think that our father will leave here tonight .
yes , i ’ m sure he will — to stay with you .
next month he ’ ll stay with us .
he ’ s so flighty in his old age , as we keep noticing .
he has always loved cordelia best , and his bad judgment in disowning her now is obvious .
the queen is here on special business , and her army has moved on .
thank you , sir .
gentle gods in heaven , please let me die .
don ’ t tempt me to suicide again .
pray well , father .
and who are you , good sir ?
i ’ m a poor man who ’ s been humbled by many misfortunes .
thank you very much .
may heaven bless you .
what good luck !
that blind head of yours was created to make me rich .
you old traitor , repent all your sins .
i hope you ’ re strong enough to do it .
whoa , man , you dare to support someone who ’ s been proclaimed a traitor ?
get out of here , before his bad luck infects you too .
let go of his arm .
oh no , sir , i won ’ t let him go , sir , not without a good reason .
let go of him , peasant , or you die !
i ’ ll knock your teeth out , sir .
to hell with your sword .
i know you well .
you ’ re a hardworking villain who ’ d do anything his evil mistress wanted him to .
is he dead ?
let ’ s look in his pockets .
the letters he spoke of may help me .
he ’ s dead .
i ’ m just sorry i had to be the one to kill him .
let ’ s see here .
come on , envelope , open up for me .
reading their mail isn ’ t as bad .
don ’ t forget the vows we made to each other .
the king is insane .
it ’ d be better to be delirious and unaware of anything .
give me your hand .
i think i hear the drums far away .
come , father , i ’ ll leave you at a friend ’ s house .
oh , kent , what could i ever do to become as good as you are ?
i won ’ t live long enough , and all my efforts will fail me .
just being thanked is more than enough for me , madam .
i hope all reports about me simply tell the truth , no more or less .
change into better clothes .
please take them off .
i have to ask you , as a favor , not to let on that you recognize me until the time is right .
all right , my lord . — how ’ s the king doing ?
he ’ s still sleeping , ma 'am .
would you mind if we woke up the king ?
he ’ s slept a long time .
is he in his royal garments ?
yes , ma 'am .
stay close by when we wake him up , ma 'am .
i ’ m sure he will stay under control .
all right .
please come closer . — make the music louder , please !
kind and dear princess !
if you hadn ’ t been their father , your white hair would have inspired in them only compassion .
and were you then happy to find shelter on a bed of hay along with swine and homeless bums ?
oh , oh !
it ’ s a wonder you didn ’ t lose your life and your mind all at once . — he ’ s waking up .
talk to him .
you talk to him , ma 'am .
that ’ s most appropriate .
how are you , my royal lord ?
how is your majesty doing ?
you do me wrong by taking me out of the grave .
even my tears burn me like molten lead .
sir , do you know who i am ?
you ’ re a spirit , i know .
where did you die ?
let him be for a bit .
where have i been ?
where am i ?
is it daytime ?
i ’ ve been tricked .
i would die of pity to see someone else in my condition .
i don ’ t know what to say .
i can ’ t even be sure these are my hands .
let ’ s see .
i feel this pinprick .
i wish i knew what is happening .
please don ’ t make fun of me .
i ’ m a foolish , senile old man , eighty-something years old , not an hour more or less .
to put it plainly , i ’ m afraid i ’ m not quite sane .
i feel i should recognize you and that man
i can ’ t recall where i slept last night .
don ’ t laugh at me , but i swear i think this lady is my child cordelia .
and i am , i am .
are your tears wet ?
yes , indeed they are .
please don ’ t cry .
if you have poison for me , i ’ ll drink it .
but you didn ’ t , even though you had every reason .
i had no reason , no reason .
am i in france ?
you ’ re in your own kingdom , sir .
don ’ t deceive me .
you can relax , ma 'am .
his insane period is over .
but it ’ s dangerous to make him try to make sense of the time he lost .
ask him to go in .
don ’ t trouble him further until his mind is more settled .
would your highness like to take a walk ?
you ’ ll have to bear with me .
please forgive and forget .
i ’ m old and foolish .
is it true , sir , that the duke of cornwall was killed as they say ?
yes , it ’ s true , sir .
who is leading his men ?
they say gloucester ’ s bastard son is .
i hear that edgar , gloucester ’ s exiled son , is with the earl of kent in germany .
you can ’ t trust all the rumors .
it ’ s time to reassess the situation .
the british troops are coming near .
it will likely be a bloody fight .
goodbye , sir .
i ’ m afraid that may be the case , madam .
now , my sweet lord , you know how much i like you .
tell me truthfully , do you love my sister ?
no .
i ’ m just worried that you ’ ve been cozying up to her , and gotten intimate with her .
no , i swear on my honor , i haven ’ t , madam .
he ’ s going senile .
but then again he ’ s never really understood his own feelings very well .
yes , he was hotheaded even in the prime of his life .
now that he ’ s old , we can expect to have to deal not only with his old character flaws , which have turned into deep-rooted habits , but also with the uncontrollable crabbiness that comes with old age .
we ’ ll probably witness many more outbursts from him , like banishing kent .
there ’ s still the king of france ’ s farewell ceremony .
let ’ s put our heads together .
if our father continues to use his authority as usual , then his recent abdication of the kingdom will just hurt us .
we ’ ll have to think about it carefully .
we have to strike while the iron ’ s hot .
i can ’ t stand her .
please , my lord , don ’ t be friendly with her .
don ’ t worry about me . — your sister and the duke are here .
noble words , sir .
why are we talking about this ?
then let ’ s meet with our senior command and discuss what to do next .
i ’ ll meet you at your tent .
goneril , are you coming with us ?
no .
it ’ s the best thing to do .
please come with me .
wait until i read the letter .
i was ordered not to .
when the time comes , tell the herald to blow the trumpet and i ’ ll return .
goodbye , then .
i ’ ll take a look at your letter .
prepare your troops .
we ’ ll be ready when the time comes .
which one of them should i pick ?
both ?
one ?
neither ?
i can ’ t enjoy either of them as long as the other one ’ s alive .
goneril would go crazy if i chose regan , but it would be hard to get in with goneril while her husband ’ s still alive .
i ’ ll use albany ’ s power and authority for now to win the war , but afterward one of the sisters — whichever one wants to — can get rid of him .
if i ever come back , i ’ ll bring you good news .
good luck , sir .
we have to get out of here , old man .
let me help you up .
let ’ s go !
he and his daughter are captured .
give me your hand .
come on .
i can ’ t go any further , sir .
come on .
and that ’ s true too .
officers , take them away .
guard them carefully until we decide how to punish them .
no , no , no , no !
come on , let ’ s go to prison .
the two of us together will sing like birds in a cage .
when you ask for my blessing , i ’ ll get down on my knees and ask you to forgive me .
in prison we ’ ll outlast hordes of rulers that will come and go as their fortunes change .
take them away .
my cordelia , even the gods admire how much you ’ ve sacrificed for me .
have i hugged you yet ?
anyone who wants to separate us will have to smoke us out of the cave of our togetherness like foxes .
wipe your eyes .
our jailers will shrivel up with old age before they make us cry again .
we ’ ll watch them starve to death first .
come on .
come here , captain .
listen .
i ’ ll do it , sir .
when you ’ ve finished , you ’ ll be a happy man .
go immediately , and do exactly as i wrote down .
i can ’ t pull a cart or eat dried oats like a horse .
if it ’ s work for a man , i ’ ll do it .
tody of them so i can do what ’ s best out of concern for their honor and the safety of the kingdom .
i sent the french queen with him too , for the same reason .
we need a more appropriate place to discuss cordelia and her father .
i ’ m sorry , sir , but in this war i consider you a subordinate , not my equal .
that ’ s for to me to decide .
not so fast .
he has distinguished himself as a great soldier in his own right , deserving more than any honor your can bestow on him .
he ’ d really be your proxy if he married you .
you ’ re so infatuated with him that you ’ re hallucinating .
are you trying to sleep with him ?
nor is it up to you , my lord .
yes it is , you half-blood .
hang on a second .
what a farce !
you ’ ve got a sword , gloucester .
blow the trumpets .
oh , i ’ m sick , sick !
i feel sicker and sicker .
she ’ s not feeling well .
take her to my tent .
come here , herald . — let the trumpet sound ! — read this out .
blow the trumpet !
again !
again !
who are you ?
all right then , legitimate brother edgar , i have to have your lands .
look out , i ’ m on my way up .
kent ’ s been banished just like that ?
all this so suddenly ? — edmund , what ’ s going on ?
what ’ s the news ?
i ’ ve lost my name and title to a traitor .
but i ’ m as noble as my opponent .
and who is that ?
who ’ s the spokesman for edmund , earl of gloucester ?
i ’ m my own spokesman .
what do you have to say to me ?
here ’ s mine .
normally i would ask you what your name is first .
still fight you and embed your lies back in your hellish heart . — trumpets , blow !
you were tricked into fighting , gloucester .
according to the laws of war , you didn ’ t have to fight a stranger .
i make the laws , not you .
who can prosecute me for it ?
oh , monstrous !
don ’ t ask me what i know .
follow her .
she ’ s desperate .
i ’ ve done everything you accuse me of — and more , much more .
you ’ ll find out everything in due time .
it ’ s all over now , and so am i. let ’ s forgive each other .
i ’ m no less noble than you are , edmund .
if i ’ m more noble than you , you ’ ve done me wrong .
my name is edgar , and i ’ m your father ’ s son .
the gods are fair , and they use our little vices to punish us .
you ’ re right .
that ’ s true .
let me embrace you .
i swear i never hated you or your father !
i know , prince .
where have you been hiding ?
how did you know what happened to your poor father ?
listen to my little story , and when it ’ s done , oh , my heart will break !
to escape the decree condemning me
i became his guide , i led him and begged for him , and kept him from suicide .
i never — oh , what a mistake ! — revealed myself to him until half an hour ago , when i was in my armor .
but his frail heart , too weak to grapple with such a conflict between joy and sadness , gave out .
your words have moved me , and maybe it ’ ll do some good .
but go on .
you look like you have something more to say .
if there ’ s anything more sorrowful left to add , keep it to yourself .
i ’ m almost ready to break down hearing this much .
this may have seemed like the pinnacle of sadness , but if i went on i could outdo it .
then i heard the trumpets blow twice , and left him there in a trance .
but who was that man ?
it was kent , sir , the exiled kent , who , after the king treated him like an enemy of the state , put on a disguise and followed his king , carrying out tasks unworthy of even a slave .
help , help , oh , help !
what kind of help do you need ?
say something , man !
what is that bloody knife ?
it ’ s still warm from the cut .
it was just removed from from the heart of — oh , she ’ s dead !
who ’ s dead ?
speak , man .
your wife , sir , your wife .
and her sister ’ s dead too , poisoned by your wife .
she confessed .
i was engaged to both of them .
all three of us will marry now in death .
here comes kent .
i thought the king preferred the duke of albany to the duke of cornwall .
we used to think so too .
but the way he ’ s divided the kingdom recently , nobody can tell which of the dukes he favors more .
yes , i ’ ve been responsible for his upbringing .
i ’ ve had to acknowledge that he ’ s my son so many times that now i can do it without embarrassment .
do you smell something naughty ?
well , i wouldn ’ t want to undo the naughtiness , since the boy turned out so well .
but i have a legitimate son a few years older than this one , and i don ’ t love him any more than i love my bastard .
oh , is that kent ?
i ’ ve come to say farewell to my king and master .
isn ’ t he here ?
what an enormous thing for us to forget ! — edmund , tell us , where ’ s the king ?
and where ’ s cordelia ? — do you see this , kent ?
oh , why is this so ?
still , edmund was beloved .
one of the sisters poisoned the other out of love for me , and then killed herself .
apparently so . — cover their faces .
i wish i could live longer .
i want to do a little good despite my evil nature .
go quickly — hurry — to the castle , for i ’ ve given orders to have lear and cordelia killed .
hurry , send someone immediately !
run , run , oh , run !
whom should we look for in the castle ? — whose job is it ?
send something along to prove you ’ re withdrawing the orders .
good idea .
take my sword .
the captain — give it to the captain .
run as if your life depended on it .
my wife and i ordered him to hang cordelia in prison and then to make it look as if she committed suicide in despair .
heaven help her ! — get him out of here for now .
howl , howl , howl , howl !
oh , you men are made of stone !
if i were you with eyes and a tongue to speak with , i ’ d crack heaven wide open with my laments !
she ’ s gone forever .
i know how to tell when someone is alive or dead .
she ’ s as dead as the cold ground .
let me borrow a mirror .
if her breath steams up the glass , then she ’ s alive .
or just a foretaste of it ?
let the world collapse around us .
this feather moved because of her breath .
she ’ s alive .
if that ’ s true , it makes up for all the sorrows i ’ ve ever known .
oh , my good master !
please , go away .
it ’ s noble kent , your friend .
curse you all , you ’ re all murderers and traitors !
i could have saved her .
now she ’ s gone forever . — cordelia , cordelia , stay a while .
ha ?
it ’ s true , my lords , he did .
didn ’ t i ?
but i ’ m old now , and suffering has weakened me .
my vision is dull .
aren ’ t you kent ?
that ’ s me .
your servant kent .
where ’ s your servant
he ’ s a good fellow , i can tell you that much .
he ’ s dead and rotting in the dirt now .
no , my lord , that was me .
i ’ m the one who — i ’ ll get right on that .
followed you on your sad wanderings , ever since your bad luck began .
nice to see you .
it was me , no one else .
everything is gloomy , dark , and dreadful .
your eldest daughters destroyed themselves and died in despair .
yes , i think that ’ s true .
he doesn ’ t know what he ’ s saying .
edmund is dead , my lord .
as for me , i ’ m surrendering all my power over to him , giving him absolute authority for the rest of his life .
and my poor he ’ s fainted . — my lord , my lord !
don ’ t disturb his soul .
let it go up to heaven .
oh , he ’ s really gone .
what ’ s amazing is how long he lasted .
carry them away .
our business now is mourning and grief .
why are you hiding that letter ?
i don ’ t have any news to report , my lord .
what ’ s that paper you were reading ?
it ’ s nothing , my lord .
no ?
then why did you have to stick it in your pocket in such a hurry ?
if it were nothing , you wouldn ’ t need to hide it .
please , sir , i beg you .
it ’ s a letter from my brother that i haven ’ t finished reading yet .
give me that letter , sir .
now i ’ ll offend you whether i give it to you or not .
the problem is in what the letter says , as far as i can tell .
i hope for my brother ’ s sake that he just wrote it to test my honor .
i will have to go on a journey to death soon , sir .
my master ’ s calling me .
i can ’ t say no .
we must remember the gravity of this sad day .
we should speak what we feel , not what we ought to say .
come talk to me about this .
if our father were dead you ’ d receive half of his revenue forever , and you ’ d have my undying love , edgar . ” hmm , what ’ s this , a conspiracy ?
how could he have even entertained these thoughts in his heart ?
how did you get this letter ?
who delivered it ?
nobody delivered it , my lord .
that ’ s what ’ s clever about it .
it was tossed into the window of my room .
you ’ re sure the handwriting is your brother ’ s ?
if he ’ d written nice things , i ’ d swear yes right away .
but as it stands , i wish i could believe it wasn ’ t .
but it is his handwriting ?
it ’ s his handwriting , my lord , but i hope he didn ’ t mean what he wrote .
has he ever tested out these ideas on you before ?
never , my lord .
but i ’ ve often heard him argue that when sons are at their prime and their fathers are declining , the sons should be their fathers ' guardians and manage their fathers ' money .
oh , what a villain !
that ’ s just what he said in the letter .
evil villain !
go look for him .
i ’ ll arrest him .
horrid villain !
where is he ?
i ’ m not sure , my lord .
i ’ ll bet my life that he only wrote this letter to gauge my love for you , and for no other reason .
do you think so ?
he can ’ t possibly be such a monster — and i ’ m sure he isn ’ t .
toward his own father who loves him so completely .
oh , god !
edmund , go find him .
i ’ ll find him right away , sir , and carry out the business as well as i can .
these recent eclipses of the sun and moon don ’ t bode well for us .
though science can explain them away , disasters still come after eclipses .
love cools off , friendships break up , and brothers become enemies .
break out , civil war erupts , kings are betrayed , and the bond between father and son snaps .
this wicked son of mine confirms the prediction — son against father .
the king acts unnaturally — father against child .
we ’ ve seen the best our age has to offer .
conspiracies , fakery , betrayal , and disorder are all that ’ s left until we die .
find out what this villainous edgar is thinking , edmund .
you won ’ t lose any respect .
just do it carefully . — and to think that the noble and loyal kent has been banished , for the crime of telling the truth !
it ’ s strange , strange .
my father and mother coupled when the demonic moon was descending , and i was born under the big dipper , so it ’ s inevitable that i ’ m rude and oversexed .
i would have been what i am even if the most virginal star in the heavens had twinkled at my conception .
fa , sol , la , mi .
hello , brother edmund .
what are you thinking about so seriously ?
how long have you believed in astrology ?
come on .
when was the last time you saw my father ?
why , last night .
did you speak to him ?
yes , we talked for a couple of hours .
did you leave on good terms ?
did he express any dissatisfaction with you , either in his words or his face ?
no , none at all .
some villain has told lies about me .
that ’ s what i ’ m afraid of .
i suggest you lay low until his rage cools a little .
in the meantime , come home with me , and when the time is right i ’ ll take you to talk to him .
please go .
here ’ s my key .
if you go outside , arm yourself .
arm myself ?
brother , i ’ m giving you good advice .
arm yourself .
now please go .
will i hear from you soon ?
i ’ ll help you through this business .
a gullible father and a brother who ’ s so innocent that he can ’ t suspect anyone else of wanting to hurt him — these are the two fools i need for my plan to work .
i know exactly how to proceed .
if i can ’ t have an estate by birthright , then i ’ ll get it by being clever .
any trick that works is good for me .
did my father hit one of my attendants for scolding his fool ?
yes , ma 'am .
he constantly offends me .
every hour he comes out with some horrible new offense that puts us all on edge .
i won ’ t stand for it .
his knights are getting out of control , and he himself reprimands us about every little detail .
when he comes back from hunting , i ’ m not going to speak to him .
tell him i ’ m sick .
and if you ’ re not as attentive in serving him as you used to be , that ’ ll be good .
i ’ ll take responsibility for it .
he ’ s coming , ma 'am .
i hear him .
be as lazy and neglectful as you like around him — you and the other servants .
if he doesn ’ t like it , he can go live with my sister .
that useless old man still thinks he can wield all the powers he ’ s given away .
i swear , old fools become like babies again .
remember what i ’ ve told you .
very well , ma 'am .
and make sure the servants are less friendly to his knights .
don ’ t worry about the consequences .
tell your men as much .
i want this to provoke confrontations , so i can give him a piece of my mind .
i ’ ll write to my sister and tell her my plans .
now go , set up for dinner .
if i can disguise my voice as well as my appearance , then i ’ ll be able to carry out my plan perfectly .
i love my master , and he ’ ll find me very hard-working .
don ’ t make me wait for dinner even a moment .
get it ready immediately .
a man , sir .
what ’ s your profession ?
what do you want from me ?
but who are you ?
an honest guy who ’ s as poor as the king .
if you ’ re as poor a subject as he is a king , you definitely are poor .
what do you want ?
to work as a servant .
who do you want to work for ?
you .
do you know me ?
authority .
what work can you do ?
i can be discreet in honorable matters , ride a horse , run , tell a good story badly , and deliver a plain message bluntly .
i ’ m good at everything that ordinary men can do .
the best thing about me is that i ’ m hardworking .
how old are you ?
not young enough to fall in love with a woman because she sings well , but not old enough to dote on a woman for any reason .
i ’ m forty-eight .
follow me .
you ’ ll work for me .
where ’ s my fool ? — go call my fool and have him come here .
no , i don ’ t , my lord .
very pleased to meet you , my lord .
i look forward to getting to know you better .
i ’ ll try to make myself worth your knowledge .
he ’ s been gone for nine years and he ’ s leaving again soon .
the king is coming .
go escort the lords of france and burgundy , gloucester .
yes , my lord .
you , sir , where ’ s my daughter ?
i beg your pardon , sir — what did that guy say ?
call the numbskull back in here .
where ’ s my fool ?
you ’ d think everyone was asleep .
so what ’ s going on ?
where ’ s that dog ?
he says your daughter ’ s not feeling well , my lord .
why didn ’ t the jerk come back to me when i called him ?
sir , he told me quite bluntly that he didn ’ t feel like it .
didn ’ t feel like it ?
my lord , i don ’ t know what ’ s going on , but it seems to me that your highness isn ’ t being treated as politely as before .
the servants , the duke , and your daughter all seem to be treating you less kindly .
huh !
do you really mean that ?
please forgive me if i ’ m mistaken , my lord — but i can ’ t keep quiet when i think you ’ re being insulted .
no , you ’ re just reminding me of something i ’ ve also noticed .
i ’ ve felt neglected recently , but i decided that it was more likely that i was being hypersensitive than that they were intentionally unkind .
i ’ ll look into it further .
but where ’ s my fool ?
i haven ’ t seen him for two days .
ever since cordelia left for france , sir , the fool has been depressed .
let ’ s not talk about it .
i ’ ve noticed it myself .
go and tell my daughter i want to speak with her .
and you , go call my fool .
you there , sir , come here please .
who am i , sir ?
you scoundrel !
you lowlife son-of-a-bitch !
you dog , you peasant !
i won ’ t be hit , my lord .
now , my friendly servant , thank you .
wait , let me hire him too . — here ’ s my fool ’ s cap , a token of my gratitude .
well hello , my good boy .
how are you doing ?
why , fool ?
why ?
for standing up for this unpopular king .
no , if you can ’ t adjust to political changes , you ’ ll suffer for it .
there , take my fool ’ s cap .
this guy here has banished two of his daughters and blessed the third one without intending to .
if you work for him , you ’ re a fool and should wear a fool ’ s cap . — so how ’ s it going , uncle ?
i wish i had two fool ’ s caps and two daughters .
why , my boy ?
if i gave them all i own , i ’ d have two fool ’ s caps for myself .
here ’ s mine .
ask your daughters for another one .
watch out , boy — remember i can whip you .
a constant pain to me !
i ’ ll recite something for you , guy .
yes , do that .
listen up , uncle .
it ’ s nothing .
in that case it ’ s like the words of an unpaid lawyer .
why , no , boy .
nothing can be made out of nothing .
you ’ re a bitter fool .
do you know the difference , my boy , between a bitter fool and a sweet one ?
no , son .
tell me .
bring here the gentleman who advised you to give away your land .
you can stand in his place .
the sweet and bitter fool will appear right away .
the sweet fool in a fool ’ s costume — that ’ s me .
the bitter one is the other one — that ’ s you.lear are you calling me a fool , boy ?
well , you ’ ve given away all your other rightful titles .
no .
which two crowns would those be ?
well , when i cut the egg in half and eat the whites , the yolk will be in two parts like two golden crowns .
if i ’ m telling the truth like a fool in saying all this , whip the first person who thinks i sound foolish .
when did you become so fond of singing , boy ?
i ’ ve been singing ever since you made your daughters into your mothers by giving them all your power .
that ’ s when you gave them the spanking paddle and pulled your pants down , please , uncle , hire a teacher who can teach your fool to lie .
i want to learn how to lie .
if you lie , boy , we ’ ll have you whipped .
i ’ m amazed how similar you and your daughters are .
they want to whip me for telling the truth , you want to whip me for lying , and sometimes i ’ m even whipped for keeping quiet .
i ’ d rather be anything besides a fool .
and yet i wouldn ’ t want to be you , uncle .
here comes the owner of one piece .
what ’ s going on , daughter ?
why are you frowning like that ?
i think you ’ ve been frowning too much recently .
the man who gives away his crust and his crumbs will discover that he needs some crumbs back .
will damage your reputation with them — and under ordinary circumstances it would be unfortunate to have them see you as an ogre .
however , this is an extreme situation , and it ’ s more important to control it than to worry about how you ’ ll look .
you know , uncle , a sparrow once raised a cuckoo in its nest until the cuckoo grew up and bit the sparrow ’ s head off .
so the candle went out and now we ’ re all in the dark .
are you my daughter ?
does anyone here know who i am ?
i ’ m not lear .
where are his eyes ?
i don ’ t think so .
who can tell me who i am ?
you ’ re lear ’ s shadow .
daughters who can make you obey them .
this fake astonishment of yours is just like your other pranks .
i ’ m asking you to understand my point of view .
since you ’ re old and respected , you should be wise .
but you ’ re keeping a hundred knights here who are so disorderly , vulgar , and obnoxious that our noble court is starting to look like a noisy cheap hotel .
they ’ re such oversexed gluttons that i feel like we ’ re living in a pub or a whorehouse rather than a respectable palace .
it ’ s shameful , and we have to make some changes right away .
hell and damnation !
saddle up my horses .
call my knights together .
you ’ re not really my daughter , but i still have one daughter left .
you hit my servants , and your disorderly mob of knights treat their superiors like servants .
you ’ ll be sorry later , but it ’ ll be too late .
ingratitude is always hideous , but an ungrateful child is uglier than a sea monster !
please , sir , be patient .
that may be true , my lord .
ah , dear nature , my goddess , listen to me !
make her sterile and dry up her womb so that no baby will ever come out of her body and honor her .
this land will belong to your and albany ’ s children forever . — and now what does my second daughter regan , the wife of cornwall , have to say ?
tell me .
dear gods in heaven , what ’ s the reason for this ?
and then you ’ ll see that despite what you thought , i ’ ll be as powerful as i was before .
you ’ ll see , i promise you .
did you hear that ?
goneril , you know how much i love you , but still i have to say — shush , please .
come , sir , no more . — oswald , come here !
a fox you ’ ve trapped and such a daughter should both be slaughtered , if my fool ’ s cap is worth a rope to bind them .
so the fool follows you .
my father can ’ t think straight — a hundred knights !
you may be exaggerating the risks .
that ’ s better than exaggerating our trust .
it ’ s always better to get rid of what you ’ re scared of than to be afraid .
i know how his mind works .
i ’ ve written to my sister telling her everything he ’ s said .
if she welcomes him and his hundred knights after i ’ ve shown how inappropriately he ’ s behaved — here , ma 'am .
well , oswald ?
have you written that letter to my sister yet ?
yes , ma 'am .
take some men and horses and go to her .
add details of your own to back up what i ’ m saying .
now go , and hurry back .
but people often screw things up trying to make them better .
no , not at all — all right , all right .
i won ’ t sleep until i ’ ve delivered your letter , my lord .
if a man ’ s brain were in his feet , wouldn ’ t it be susceptible to frostbite ?
yes , boy .
ha , ha , ha !
your other daughter regan will treat you kindly , you ’ ll see .
even though she ’ s as similar to goneril as one crabapple is like another , still … i know what i know .
and what do you know , boy ?
i know that regan will taste just like goneril — both of them sour crabapples .
do you know why the nose is in the middle of a person ’ s face ?
no .
why , to keep the eyes on the sides , so that you can see anything that you can ’ t sniff out .
i was wrong to her — do you know how an oyster makes its shell ?
no .
me neither .
but i know why a snail carries its house on its back .
why ?
he can ’ t give his house away to his daughters , leaving himself without shelter .
i want to forget what i am .
such a kind father ! — are my horses ready ?
your attendant asses are getting the horses ready .
there ’ s a nice reason why the constellation pleiades has only seven stars in it .
because it doesn ’ t have eight ?
that ’ s right .
you ’ d make a good fool .
i could take back my crown by force — what outrageous ingratitude !
if you were my fool , uncle , i ’ d have you beaten for getting old before your time .
how ’ s that ?
you ’ re not supposed to get old until you ’ re wise .
oh , dear god , don ’ t let me go mad !
keep me balanced and sane .
i don ’ t want to go mad .
they ’ re ready , my lord .
come on , boy .
hello , curan .
hello , sir .
i just saw your father the lord gloucester and notified him that the duke of cornwall and his wife regan will stay with him here tonight .
why is that ?
i don ’ t know .
you haven ’ t heard of the war brewing between the dukes of cornwall and albany ?
not a word .
you may hear about it soon .
goodbye , sir .
the duke will be here tonight ?
his arrival fits perfectly into my plan .
fast work and a little luck are all i need . — brother , could i have a word with you ?
come down , brother .
father is on the lookout .
get out of here quickly !
it has leaked out that you ’ re hiding here .
you haven ’ t said anything against the duke of cornwall , have you ?
he ’ s rushing on his way here right now , and regan ’ s with him .
think about it .
i hear my father coming .
forgive me .
i have to pretend to threaten you with my sword .
be convincing .
edmund , where ’ s your wicked brother ?
look , sir , i ’ m bleeding .
where is the villain , edmund ?
he ran out that way , sir , when he couldn ’ t — follow him , now !
go .
when he couldn ’ t what ?
in short , when i told him how firmly opposed i was to his hideous plan , he pulled out his sword and lunged at my defenseless body , cutting my arm .
bolstered by righteousness , i prepared to fight , and when he saw my excitement — or perhaps because my shouting scared him — he ran away suddenly .
let him run far away .
if he stays in this country he ’ ll be found .
the duke of cornwall , my master and patron , is arriving tonight .
joy except my love for you , and i find that only your majesty ’ s love makes me happy .
speak .
nothing , my lord .
nothing ?
nothing .
come on , “ nothing ” will get you nothing .
try again .
i don ’ t have a talent for putting my heart ’ s feelings into words .
i love you as a child should love her father , neither more nor less .
what are you saying , cordelia ?
revise your statement , or you may damage your inheritance .
justice will be rewarded .
he answered , “ you penniless bastard !
do you really think that if it came down to my word against yours , anyone would believe you ?
no .
i ’ d deny whatever evidence you had against me — even if it were in my own handwriting — and turn it all into evidence against you and your plans for treachery .
and you must think people are stupid if you believe they wouldn ’ t realize all the motives you have for trying to kill me . ” oh , how monstrously evil !
he said he would deny that he wrote his letter ?
the duke ’ s trumpets .
i don ’ t know why he ’ s come here .
i ’ ll forbid all ships from leaving our harbors .
the villain won ’ t escape .
the duke will agree with me on that .
how are you , my friend ?
ever since i arrived here , just now , i ’ ve been hearing strange rumors .
how are you , my lord ?
oh , madam , my old heart is broken , broken .
oh , my lady , i ’ m ashamed to admit it .
wasn ’ t he friends with all those brawling knights who serve my father ?
i don ’ t know , madam .
oh , it ’ s too terrible .
to answer your question , ma 'am — yes , he was friendly with those knights .
then it ’ s no surprise they had a bad influence on him .
they probably put him up to killing old man gloucester to get his money .
tonight i received a letter from my sister telling me all about them — and warning me not be at home in case they come to stay at my house .
and i won ’ t be there either . — edmund , i ’ m told you ’ ve acted like a true son to your father .
i just did my duty , sir .
he exposed edgar ’ s murderous plot , and was wounded , as you see there , when trying to apprehend him .
are your men searching for him ?
yes , my lord .
if he ’ s caught , he ’ ll never make trouble for anyone again .
i need people as trustworthy as you .
i ’ ll always be loyal to you , sir .
you don ’ t know why we came to visit you — yes , and so unexpectedly , at night .
their messengers are ready , waiting to deliver our response in these matters .
so please , old friend , give us some good advice .
i ’ m at your service , madam .
both of you are very welcome here .
good morning to you , friend .
do you work in this house ?
yes , i do .
where should we stable our horses ?
in the mud .
please , sir , be kind to me and tell me .
i won ’ t be kind to you .
in that case , i don ’ t much care for you either .
if i could get my hands on you , i ’ d make you care .
why are you talking to me like this ?
i don ’ t even know you .
ah , but i know you .
who am i then ?
what an ogre you are to slander someone you don ’ t know , and who doesn ’ t know you !
what a shameless jerk you are to pretend you don ’ t know me !
it was just two days ago that i tripped you and beat you up in front of the king .
draw your sword , scoundrel .
i ’ ll make ground beef out of you .
get away from me !
i ’ ve got nothing to do with you .
draw your sword , you jerk !
you come here with letters against the king , and you take his conceited daughter ’ s side against his royal highness .
draw your sword , scoundrel , or i ’ ll slice your thighs like flank steak .
draw your sword !
come on !
help !
murderer !
help !
stand and fight , you overdressed servant , fight !
help !
murder , murder !
macbeth .
then stay with us .
there ’ s still a bit of daylight in the sky .
now all the late travellers are hurrying to reach their inns .
the rest of the king ’ s guests are already inside .
that ’ s him .
prepare yourselves .
it will rain tonight .
then let the rain come down .
oh , this is treachery !
get out of here , good fleance , run , run , run !
someday you can get revenge . — oh , you bastard !
who put out the light ?
wasn ’ t that the best thing to do ?
there ’ s only one body here .
the son ran away .
we failed in half of our mission .
well , let ’ s get out of here and tell macbeth what we did accomplish .
from the highest to the lowest of you , i bid you a hearty welcome .
thanks to your majesty .
i will walk around and mingle with all of you , playing the humble host .
say welcome to all of our friends for me , sir , for in my heart they are all welcome .
and they respond to you with their hearts as well .
the table is full on both sides .
i will sit here in the middle .
be free and happy .
soon we will toast around the table .
then it must be banquo ’ s .
my lord , his throat is cut .
i did that to him .
you are the best of the cutthroats .
if you cut both their throats , then you are the absolute best .
most royal sir , fleance has escaped .
now i ’ m scared again .
otherwise i would have been perfect , as solid as a piece of marble , as firm as a rock , as free as the air itself .
yes , my good lord .
he ’ s lying dead in a ditch , with twenty deep gashes in his head , any one of which would have been enough to kill him .
thanks for that .
the adult snake lies in the ditch .
the young snake that escaped will in time become poisonous and threatening , but for now he has no fangs .
get out of here .
i ’ ll talk to you again tomorrow .
my royal lord , you ’ re not entertaining the guests .
when you just want to eat , it ’ s better to do that at home .
where have you been , sister ?
killing pigs .
and you , sister ?
a sailor ’ s wife had chestnuts in her lap and munched away at them .
give me one , ” i said .
get away from me , witch ! ” the fat woman cried .
how nice of you !
and i will give you some more .
i ’ ll drain the life out of him .
he won ’ t catch a wink of sleep , either at night or during the day .
he will live as a cursed man .
for eighty-one weeks he will waste away in agony .
it ’ s nice of you to remind me .
why don ’ t you have a seat , your highness ?
his absence means he ’ s broken his promise , sir .
if it pleases you , your highness , why don ’ t you sit with us and grace us with your royal company ?
the table ’ s full .
here ’ s an empty seat , sir .
where ?
what , my good lord ?
gentlemen , stand up .
his highness is not well .
sit down , worthy friends .
my husband is often like this , and he has been since he was a child .
please stay seated .
if you pay too much attention to him you ’ ll make him angry , and that will make his convulsions go on longer .
eat your dinner and pay no attention to him .
yes , and a brave one , who dares to look at something that would frighten the devil .
oh , that ’ s nonsense !
this is just another one of the hallucinations you always get when you ’ re afraid .
these outbursts of yours don ’ t even look like real fear .
they ’ re more like how you would act if you were a woman telling a scary story by the fireside in front of her grandmother .
shame on you !
why are you making these faces ?
when the vision passes , you ’ ll see that you ’ re just looking at a stool .
please , just look over there .
look !
look !
as sure as i ’ m standing here , i saw him .
nonsense !
it used to be that when you knocked a man ’ s brains out he would just die , and that would be it .
but now they rise from the dead with twenty fatal head wounds and push us off our stools .
this haunting business is even stranger than murder .
my worthy lord , your noble friends miss your company .
too bad it ’ s spoiling our pleasure tonight .
come at me in the form of a rugged russian bear , an armor-plated rhinoceros , or a tiger from iran .
or come back to life again and challenge me to a duel in some deserted place .
if i tremble then , you can call me a little girl .
get out of here , you horrible ghost , you hallucination .
get out !
i am a man again .
pray you sit still .
please , remain seated .
what things , my lord ?
please , don ’ t speak to him .
he ’ s getting worse and worse .
talk makes him crazy .
good night .
a kind good night to all !
gravestones have been known to move , and trees to speak , to bring guilty men to justice .
it ’ s almost morning .
did you send for him , sir ?
i ’ ve heard about this indirectly , but i will send for him .
in every one of the lords ' households i have a servant paid to spy for me .
tomorrow , while it ’ s still early , i will go see the witches .
they will tell me more , because i ’ m determined to know the worst about what ’ s going to happen .
my own safety is the only important thing now .
i have to do these things before i have a chance to think about them .
yes , let ’ s go to sleep .
my strange self-delusions just come from inexperience .
we ’ re still just beginners when it comes to crime .
what ’ s wrong , hecate ?
you look angry .
don ’ t i have a reason to be angry , you disobedient hags ?
but you can make it up to me .
go away now and in the morning meet me in the pit by the river in hell .
macbeth will go there to learn his destiny .
you bring your cauldrons , your spells , your charms , and everything else .
i ’ m about to fly away .
i ’ ll spend tonight working to make something horrible happen .
i have a lot to do before noon .
an important droplet is hanging from the corner of the moon .
i ’ ll catch it before it falls to the ground .
when i work it over with magic spells , the drop will produce magical spirits that will trick macbeth with illusions .
he will be fooled into thinking he is greater than fate , he will mock death , and he will think he is above wisdom , grace , and fear .
as you all know , overconfidence is man ’ s greatest enemy .
listen !
i ’ m being called .
look , my little spirit is sitting in a foggy cloud waiting for me .
all i ’ m saying is that strange things have been going on .
clearly , men should not go out walking too late !
and who can help thinking how monstrous it was for malcolm and donalbain to kill their gracious father ?
those are the things we pine for now .
macbeth has heard this news and he is so angry that he ’ s preparing for war .
did he tell macduff to return to scotland ?
i ’ ll send my prayers with him .
although i can ’ t make his ship disappear , i can still make his journey miserable .
look what i have here .
show me , show me .
a drum , a drum !
macbeth has come .
the tawny cat has meowed three times .
my spirit friend , harpier , is yelling , “ it ’ s time , it ’ s time ! ” dance around the cauldron and throw in the poisoned entrails .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn , and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
double , double toil and trouble , fire burn and cauldron bubble .
we ’ ll cool the mixture with baboon blood .
well done !
i admire your efforts , and all of you will share the rewards .
now come sing around the cauldron like a ring of elves and fairies , enchanting everything you put in .
i can tell that something wicked is coming by the tingling in my thumbs .
doors , open up for whoever is knocking !
what ’ s going on here , you secret , evil , midnight hags ?
what are you doing ?
something there isn ’ t a word for .
tell me what i want to know .
speak .
demand .
we ’ ll answer .
would you rather hear these things from our mouths or from our master ’ s ?
call them .
let me see them .
pour in the blood of a sow who has eaten her nine offspring .
tell me , you unknown power — he can read your thoughts .
listen , but don ’ t speak .
macbeth !
macbeth !
macbeth !
beware macduff .
beware the thane of fife .
let me go .
enough .
whatever you are , thanks for your advice .
you have guessed exactly what i feared .
but one word more — he will not be commanded by you .
here ’ s another , stronger than the first .
macbeth !
if i had three ears i ’ d listen with all three .
be violent , bold , and firm .
laugh at the power of other men , because nobody born from a woman will ever harm macbeth .
but even so , i ’ ll make doubly sure .
that way i can conquer my own fear and sleep easy at night .
what is this spirit that looks like the son of a king and wears a crown on his young head ?
listen but don ’ t speak to it .
be brave like the lion and proud .
macbeth will never be defeated until birnam wood marches to fight you at dunsinane hill .
that will never happen .
who can command the forest and make the trees pull their roots out of the earth ?
these were sweet omens !
good !
my murders will never come back to threaten me until the forest of birnam gets up and moves , and i will be king for my entire natural life .
but my heart is still throbbing to know one thing .
tell me , if your dark powers can see this far : will banquo ’ s sons ever reign in this kingdom ?
don ’ t try to find out more .
i demand to be satisfied .
if you refuse , let an eternal curse fall on you .
let me know .
why is that cauldron sinking ?
and what is that music ?
show .
show .
show .
show him and make him grieve .
come like shadows and depart in the same way !
you look too much like the ghost of banquo .
go away !
what ?
is this true ?
come , sisters , let ’ s cheer him up and show him our talents .
where are they ?
gone ?
let this evil hour be marked forever in the calendar as cursed .
what does your grace want ?
did you see the weird sisters ?
no , my lord .
didn ’ t they pass by you ?
no , indeed , my lord .
i heard the galloping of horses .
who was it that came here ?
two or three men , my lord , who brought the message that macduff has fled to england .
fled to england ?
yes , my good lord .
time , you thwart my dreadful plans .
no more foolish talk .
i will do this deed before i lose my sense of purpose .
but no more spooky visions ! — where are the messengers ?
come , bring me to them .
what did he do that made him flee this land ?
you have to be patient , madam .
he had no patience .
he was crazy to run away .
even if you ’ re not a traitor , you ’ re going to look like one if you run away .
you don ’ t know whether it was wisdom or fear that made him flee .
how could it be wisdom !
to leave his wife , his children , his house , and his titles in a place so unsafe that he himself flees it !
even the fragile wren , the smallest of birds , will fight against the owl when it threatens her young ones in the nest .
his running away has everything to do with fear and nothing to do with love .
my dearest relative , i ’ m begging you , pull yourself together .
as for your husband , he is noble , wise , and judicious , and he understands what the times require .
i ’ ll say good-bye now .
it won ’ t be long before i ’ m back .
when things are at their worst they have to stop , or else improve to the way things were before .
he has a father , and yet he is fatherless .
if i stay longer , i ’ ll embarrass you and disgrace myself by crying .
i ’ m leaving now .
young man , your father ’ s dead .
what are you going to do now ?
how are you going to live ?
what ?
are you going to start eating worms and flies ?
i mean i will live on whatever i get , like birds do .
you ’ d be a pitiful bird .
you wouldn ’ t know enough to be afraid of traps .
no matter what you say , my father is not dead .
yes , he is dead .
what are you going to do for a father ?
maybe you should ask , what will you do for a husband ?
oh , i can buy twenty husbands at any market .
speak , if you can .
all hail , macbeth !
hail to you , thane of glamis !
all hail , macbeth !
hail !
hail !
hail !
you are lesser than macbeth but also greater .
you are not as happy as macbeth , yet much happier .
your descendants will be kings , even though you will not be one .
so all hail , macbeth and banquo !
if so , you ’ d be buying them to sell again .
you talk like a child , but you ’ re very smart anyway .
was my father a traitor , mother ?
yes , he was .
what is a traitor ?
someone who makes a promise and breaks it .
and is everyone who swears and lies a traitor ?
everyone who does so is a traitor and should be hanged .
and should everyone who makes promises and breaks them be hanged ?
everyone .
who should hang them ?
the honest men .
then the liars are fools , for there are enough liars in the world to beat up the honest men and hang them .
if he were dead , you ’ d be weeping for him .
if you aren ’ t weeping , it ’ s a good sign that i ’ ll soon have a new father .
silly babbler , how you talk !
bless you , fair lady !
you don ’ t know me , but i know you ’ re an important person .
i ’ m afraid something dangerous is coming toward you .
if you ’ ll take a simple man ’ s advice , don ’ t be here when it arrives .
go away and take your children .
i feel bad for scaring you like this , but it would be much worse for me to let you come to harm .
and harm is getting close !
heaven keep you safe !
where should i go ?
i haven ’ t done anything wrong .
but i have to remember that i ’ m here on earth , where doing evil is often praised , and doing good is sometimes a stupid and dangerous mistake .
so then why should i offer this womanish defense that i ’ m innocent ?
who are these men ?
where is your husband ?
i hope he ’ s not anywhere so disreputable that thugs like you can find him .
he ’ s a traitor .
you ’ re lying , you shaggy-haired villain !
what ’ s that , you runt ?
he has killed me , mother .
run away , i beg you !
let ’ s seek out some shady place where we can sit down alone and cry our hearts out .
instead of crying , let ’ s keep hold of our swords and defend our fallen homeland like honorable men .
each day new widows howl , new orphans cry , and new sorrows slap heaven in the face , until it sounds like heaven itself feels scotland ’ s anguish and screams in pain .
what you just said may perhaps be true .
this tyrant , whose mere name is so awful it hurts us to say it , was once considered an honest man .
you were one of his favorites .
he hasn ’ t done anything to harm you yet .
it would be smart to offer someone poor and innocent like me as a sacrificial lamb to satisfy an angry god like macbeth .
i am not treacherous .
but macbeth is .
even someone with a good and virtuous nature might give way to a royal command .
but i beg your pardon .
my fears can ’ t actually make you evil .
angels are still bright even though lucifer , the brightest angel , fell from heaven .
even though everything evil wants to look good , good still has to look good too .
why did you leave your wife and child vulnerable — the most precious things in your life , those strong bonds of love ?
but i beg you , don ’ t interpret my suspicions as slander against you .
you may really be honest , no matter what i think .
bleed , bleed , poor country !
i wouldn ’ t be the villain you think i am even if i were offered all of macbeth ’ s kingdom and the riches of the east too .
don ’ t be offended .
i don ’ t completely distrust you .
i do think scotland is sinking under macbeth ’ s oppression .
our country weeps , it bleeds , and each day a fresh cut is added to her wounds .
the english have promised me thousands of troops .
who are you talking about ?
even in hell you couldn ’ t find a devil worse than macbeth .
i admit that he ’ s murderous , lecherous , greedy , lying , deceitful , violent , malicious , and guilty of every sin that has a name .
but there is no end , absolutely none , to my sexual desires .
your wives , your daughters , your old women , and your young maids together could not satisfy my lust .
it would be better for macbeth to rule than someone like me .
endless greed and lust in a man ’ s nature is a kind of tyranny .
it has caused the downfall of many kings .
but don ’ t be afraid to take the crown that belongs to you .
there are more than enough willing women around .
greed has been the downfall of many kings .
but i don ’ t have any good sides .
no , if i had power i would take world peace and throw it down to hell .
oh scotland , scotland !
if someone like me is fit to be king , let me know .
i ’ m still a virgin .
indeed , before you arrived here , old siward , with ten thousand soldiers already prepared for battle , was making his way here .
why are you silent ?
it ’ s hard to make sense of such different stories .
well , we ’ ll speak more soon .
yes , sir .
their illness confounds the most advanced techniques of modern medicine , but when he touches them , they heal immediately because of the power granted to him by heaven .
thank you , doctor .
what disease is he talking about ?
it ’ s called the evil .
edward ’ s healing touch is a miracle that i have seen him perform many times during my stay in england .
along with this strange power , he also has the gift of prophecy and various other abilities .
who ’ s that coming over here ?
by his dress i can tell he ’ s my countryman , but i don ’ t recognize him .
my noble kinsman , welcome .
hello , sir .
is scotland the same as when i left it ?
alas , our poor country !
it ’ s too frightened to look at itself .
oh , your report is too poetic , but it sounds so true !
banquo and macbeth , all hail !
stay and tell me more .
tell me where you learned these strange things , and why you stop us at this desolate place with this prophetic greeting ?
speak , i command you .
the earth has bubbles , just like the water , and these creatures must have come from a bubble in the earth .
where did they disappear to ?
i wish they had stayed !
were these things we ’ re talking about really here ?
or are we both on drugs ?
your children will be kings .
you will be the king .
isn ’ t that what they said ?
that ’ s exactly what they said .
who ’ s this ?
how is my wife ?
she ’ s well .
and all my children ?
they ’ re well too .
what ’ s the news ?
now is the time when we need your help .
gracious king edward has sent us noble siward and ten thousand soldiers .
i wish i could repay this happy news with good news of my own .
what is this news about ?
if it ’ s for me , don ’ t keep it from me .
let me have it now .
i think i can guess what you ’ re about to say .
your wife and children were savagely slaughtered .
merciful heaven !
they killed my children too ?
they killed your wife , your children , your servants , anyone they could find .
and i had to be away !
my wife was killed too ?
i said she was .
take comfort .
he doesn ’ t have children .
all my pretty little children ?
did you say all ?
oh , that bird from hell !
all of them ?
what , all my children and their mother dead in one fell swoop ?
fight it like a man .
i can ’ t help remembering the things that were most precious to me .
did heaven watch the slaughter and not send down any help ?
sinful macduff , they were killed because of you !
as wicked as i am , they were slaughtered because of me , not because of anything they did .
may god give their souls rest .
let this anger sharpen your sword .
transform your grief into anger .
i could go on weeping like a woman and bragging about how i will avenge them !
but gentle heavens , don ’ t keep me waiting .
bring me face to face with macbeth , that devil of scotland .
put him within the reach of my sword , and if he escapes , may heaven forgive him as well !
now you sound like a man .
come on , let ’ s go see king edward .
the army is ready .
macbeth is ripe for the picking .
cheer up as much as you can .
i ’ ve stayed up with you for two nights now , and i haven ’ t seen any evidence of what you were talking about .
when was the last time you saw her sleepwalking ?
when she is like this , besides walking and performing various activities , have you heard her say anything ?
she says something , sir , but i will not repeat it to you .
i will not confess it to you nor to anyone else , because there was no one else to witness her speech .
look , here she comes !
this is exactly how she always looks , and — i swear it — she is fast asleep .
watch her .
how did she get that candle ?
it stands by her bedside .
she always has to have a light next to her .
those are her orders .
you see , her eyes are open .
yes , but they don ’ t see anything .
what ’ s she doing now ?
look how she rubs her hands .
she looks like she ’ s washing her hands .
there ’ s still a spot here .
listen !
she ’ s talking .
i ’ ll write down what she says , so i ’ ll remember it better .
did you hear that ?
the thane of fife had a wife .
where is she now ? — what , will my hands never be clean ? — no more of that , my lord , no more of that .
you ’ ve heard something you shouldn ’ t have .
she said something she shouldn ’ t have said , i ’ m sure of that .
heaven knows what secrets she ’ s keeping .
i still have the smell of blood on my hand .
all the perfumes of arabia couldn ’ t make my little hand smell better .
oh , oh , oh !
what a heavy sigh !
her heart is carrying a heavy weight .
i wouldn ’ t want a heart like hers even if you made me queen .
well , well , well .
i hope what she ’ s saying is well , sir !
this disease is beyond my medical skills .
but i have known people who sleepwalked and weren ’ t guilty of anything .
wash your hands .
put on your nightgown .
is this true ?
to bed , to bed !
there ’ s a knocking at the gate .
will she go to bed now ?
yes , right away .
unnatural acts will cause good night , good doctor .
the english army is near , led by malcolm , his uncle siward , and the good macduff .
they burn for revenge .
does anyone know if donalbain is with his brother ?
he is definitely not there , sir .
i have a list of all the important men .
what is the tyrant macbeth doing ?
he is fortifying his castle at dunsinane with heavy defenses .
one thing is certain : he ’ s out of control .
who can blame him for acting crazy , when inside he condemns himself for everything he ’ s done ?
let ’ s proceed on our march to birnam .
he was also shocked to learn that on the same day you fought the rebels you also fought against the army of norway , and that you weren ’ t the least bit afraid of death , even as you killed everyone around you .
messenger after messenger delivered news of your bravery to the king with praise for how you defended his country .
the king sent us to give you his thanks and to bring you to him .
why are you giving me his title ?
i don ’ t know whether he fought on norway ’ s side , or if he secretly aided the rebels , or if he fought with both of our enemies .
don ’ t bring me any more reports .
until birnam wood gets up and moves to dunsinane , i won ’ t be affected by fear .
what ’ s the boy malcolm ?
wasn ’ t he born from a woman ?
the spirits that know the future have told me this : “ don ’ t be afraid , macbeth .
no man born from a woman will ever defeat you . ” so get out of here , disloyal thanes , and join the weak and decadent english !
my mind and courage will never falter with doubt or shake with fear .
may the devil turn you black , you white-faced fool !
why do you look like a frightened goose ?
there are ten thousand — geese , you idiot ?
soldiers , sir .
go pinch your cheeks and bring some color back into your face , you cowardly boy .
what soldiers , fool ?
curse you !
that pale face of yours will frighten the others as well .
what soldiers , milk-face ?
the english army , sir .
get out of my sight .
seyton ! — i ’ m sick at heart when i see — seyton , come here ! — this battle will either secure my reign forever or else topple me from the throne .
i have lived long enough .
seyton !
what do you want ?
is there more news ?
all the rumors have been confirmed .
i ’ ll fight until they hack the flesh off my bones .
give me my armor .
you don ’ t need it yet .
i ’ ll put it on anyway .
send out more cavalry .
give me my armor .
she is not sick , my lord , but she is troubled with endless visions that keep her from sleeping .
cure her of that .
for that kind of relief , the patient must heal herself .
medicine is for the dogs .
i won ’ t have anything to do with it .
yes , my good lord .
your preparation for war sounds like something .
kinsmen , i hope the time is coming when people will be safe in their own bedrooms .
we don ’ t doubt it .
what ’ s the name of this forest behind us ?
birnam wood .
tell every soldier to break off a branch and hold it in front of him .
that way we can conceal how many of us there are , and macbeth ’ s spies will give him inaccurate reports .
we ’ ll do it .
we shouldn ’ t make any judgments until we achieve our goal .
hang our flags on the outer walls .
everyone keeps yelling , “ here they come ! ” our castle is strong enough to laugh off their seige .
they can sit out there until they die of hunger and disease .
if it weren ’ t for the fact that so many of our soldiers revolted and joined them , we could have met them out in front of the castle , man to man , and beaten them back to england .
what ’ s that noise ?
it ’ s women crying , my good lord .
i ’ ve almost forgotten what fear feels like .
there was a time when i would have been terrified by a shriek in the night , and the hair on my skin would have stood up when i heard a ghost story .
what was that cry for ?
the queen is dead , my lord .
she would have died later anyway .
tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
out , out , brief candle .
life is a story told by an idiot , full of noise and emotional disturbance but devoid of meaning .
my gracious lord , i should tell you what i saw , but i don ’ t know how to say it .
just say it .
as i was standing watch on the hill , i looked toward birnam , and i thought i saw the forest begin to move .
liar and slave !
punish me if it ’ s not true .
three miles from here you can see it coming , a moving forest .
if you ’ re lying , i ’ ll hang you alive from the nearest tree until you die of hunger .
if what you say is true , you can do the same to me .
we ’ re close enough now .
good luck .
if we meet macbeth ’ s army tonight , let us be beaten if we cannot fight .
they have me tied to a stake .
i can ’ t run away .
you ’ ll be afraid to hear it .
no i won ’ t , even if you were one of the worst demons in hell .
my name ’ s macbeth .
the devil himself couldn ’ t say a name i hate more .
no , nor could the devil ’ s name be more frightening .
you lie , you disgusting tyrant .
i ’ ll prove with my sword that i ’ m not scared of you .
you were born from a woman .
swords don ’ t frighten me .
i laugh at any weapon used by a man who was born from a woman .
but this whole thing is strange .
the noise is coming from over there .
tyrant , show your face !
i ’ ll either fight you , macbeth , or else i ’ ll put down my sword unused .
you must be over there .
come this way , my lord .
our noblemen are battling bravely .
sir , enter the castle .
turn around , you dog from hell , turn around !
but go away now .
i have nothing to say to you .
my sword will talk for me .
you are too evil for words !
you might as well try to stab the air with your sword .
i lead a charmed life , which can ’ t be ended by anyone born from a woman .
i won ’ t fight you .
then surrender , coward , and we ’ ll put you in a freakshow , just like they do with deformed animals .
even though birnam wood really did come to dunsinane , and i ’ m fighting a man not of woman born , i ’ ll fight to the end .
i ’ ll put up my shield and battle you .
come on , let ’ s go at it , macduff , and damn the first man who cries , ' stop !
enough !
macduff is missing , and so is your noble son .
my lord , your son has paid the soldier ’ s price : death .
he only lived long enough to become a man , and as soon as he proved that he was a man by fighting like one , he died .
so he ’ s dead ?
yes , and he ’ s been carried off the field .
your grief should not be equal to his worth , because then your sorrow would never end .
were his wounds on his front side ?
yes , on his front .
well then , he ’ s god ’ s soldier now !
if i had as many sons as i have hairs on my head , i couldn ’ t hope that any of them would die more honorably than he did .
and that ’ s all there is to it .
he is worth more mourning than that , and i will mourn for him .
he is worth no more than that .
they tell me he died well , and settled his scores .
with that , i hope god is with him !
here comes better news .
hail , king !
because that ’ s what you are now .
look , here i have macbeth ’ s cursed head .
we are free from his tyranny .
hail , king of scotland !
my thanes and kinsmen , i name you all earls , the first earls that scotland has ever had .
so i thank you all , and i invite each and every one of you to come watch me be crowned king of scotland at scone .
look at macbeth — he ’ s in a daze .
good macbeth , we ’ re ready when you are .
kind gentlemen , i won ’ t forget the trouble you ’ ve taken for me whenever i think of this day .
let ’ s go to the king .
absolutely .
until then , we ’ ve said enough .
my king , they haven ’ t come back yet .
but i spoke with someone who saw cawdor die , and he said that cawdor openly confessed his treasons , begged your highness ’ s forgiveness , and repented deeply .
he never did anything in his whole life that looked as good as the way he died .
he died like someone who had practiced how to toss away his most cherished possession as if it were a worthless a piece of garbage .
there ’ s no way to read a man ’ s mind by looking at his face .
you are welcome here .
with that , i ’ ll be off .
my worthy cawdor !
when should the three of us meet again ?
will it be in thunder , lightning , or rain ?
that will happen before sunset .
where should we meet ?
we ’ ll meet macbeth there .
when i tried desperately to question them further , they vanished into thin air .
while i stood spellbound , messengers from the king arrived and greeted me as the thane of cawdor , which is precisely how the weird sisters had saluted me before calling me ’ the future king !
what news do you bring ?
the king is coming here tonight .
you must be crazy to say that !
he sent a messenger ahead of him who arrived here so out of breath that he could barely speak his message .
take good care of him .
he brings great news .
my dearest love , duncan is coming here tonight .
and when is he leaving ?
he plans to leave tomorrow .
that day will never come .
your face betrays strange feelings , my lord , and people will be able to read it like a book .
greet the king with a welcoming expression in your eyes , your hands , and your words .
you should look like an innocent flower , but be like the snake that hides underneath the flower .
we will speak about this further .
leave all the rest to me .
this castle is in a pleasant place .
the air is sweet and appeals to my refined senses .
the fact that this summer bird , the house martin , builds his nests here proves how inviting the breezes are .
there isn ’ t a single protrusion in the castle walls where these birds haven ’ t built their hanging nests to sleep and breed .
i ’ ve noticed that they always like to settle and mate where the air is the nicest .
look , here comes our honored hostess !
sometimes the love my subjects bring me is inconvenient , but i still accept it as love .
fair and noble hostess , we are your guests tonight .
we are your servants , your highness , and as always our house and everything in it is at your disposal , for after all , we keep it in your trust and we ’ re glad to give you back what ’ s yours .
give me your hand .
bring me to my host , macbeth .
i love him dearly , and i shall continue to favor him .
whenever you ’ re ready , hostess .
if this business would really be finished when i did the deed , then it would be best to get it over with quickly .
what news do you have ?
he has almost finished dinner .
why did you leave the dining room ?
has he asked for me ?
don ’ t you know he has ?
we can ’ t go on with this plan .
the king has just honored me , and i have earned the good opinion of all sorts of people .
were you drunk when you seemed so hopeful before ?
from now on this is what i ’ ll think of your love .
are you afraid to act the way you desire ?
you ’ re like the poor cat in the old story .
if you weren ’ t a man , then what kind of animal were you when you first told me you wanted to do this ?
and whatever we do , we can lay all the blame on the drunken servants .
may you only give birth to male children , because your fearless spirit should create nothing that isn ’ t masculine .
once we have covered the two servants with blood , and used their daggers to kill , won ’ t people believe that they were the culprits ?
go now , and pretend to be a friendly hostess .
hide with a false pleasant face what you know in your false , evil heart .
how ’ s the night going , boy ?
the moon has set .
the clock hasn ’ t struck yet .
the moon sets at twelve , right ?
i think it ’ s later than that , sir .
here , take my sword .
the heavens are being stingy with their light .
take this , too .
i ’ m tired and feeling heavy , but i can ’ t sleep .
merciful powers , keep away the nightmares that plague me when i rest !
give me my sword .
who ’ s there ?
a friend .
you ’ re not asleep yet , sir ?
the king ’ s in bed .
he ’ s been in an unusually good mood and has granted many gifts to your household and servants .
this diamond is a present from him to your wife for her boundless hospitality .
because we were unprepared for the king ’ s visit , we weren ’ t able to entertain him as well as we would have wanted to .
who is this bloody man ?
judging from his appearance , i bet he can tell us the latest news about the revolt .
this is the brave sergeant who fought to keep me from being captured .
hail , brave friend !
tell the king what was happening in the battle when you left it .
the armies were like two exhausted swimmers clinging to each other and struggling in the water , unable to move .
my brave relative !
what a worthy man !
everything ’ s ok .
i had a dream last night about the three witches .
i don ’ t think about them now .
but when we have an hour to spare we can talk more about it , if you ’ re willing .
whenever you like .
if you stick with me , when the time comes , there will be something in it for you .
rest easy in the meantime .
thank you , sir .
you do the same .
is this a dagger i see in front of me , with its handle pointing toward my hand ?
i ’ m going now .
don ’ t listen to the bell , duncan , because it summons you either to heaven or to hell .
the alcohol that got the servants drunk has made me bold .
the same liquor that quenched their thirst has fired me up .
listen !
quiet !
my husband !
i have done the deed .
did you hear a noise ?
i heard the owl scream and the crickets cry .
didn ’ t you say something ?
when ?
just now .
as i came down ?
yes .
listen !
who ’ s sleeping in the second chamber ?
donalbain .
that ’ s a stupid thing to say .
one servant cried , “ god bless us ! ” and the other replied , “ amen , ” as if they had seen my bloody hands .
listening to their frightened voices , i couldn ’ t reply “ amen ” when they said “ god bless us ! ” don ’ t think about it so much .
but why couldn ’ t i say “ amen ” ?
i desperately needed god ’ s blessing , but the word “ amen ” stuck in my throat .
we can ’ t think that way about what we did .
if we do , it ’ ll drive us crazy .
i thought i heard a voice cry , “ sleep no more !
what are you talking about ?
the voice kept crying , “ sleep no more ! ” to everyone in the house .
go get some water and wash this bloody evidence from your hands .
why did you carry these daggers out of the room ?
they have to stay there .
go take them back and smear the sleeping guards with the blood .
coward !
give me the daggers .
only children are afraid of scary pictures .
if duncan bleeds i ’ ll paint the servants ' faces with his blood .
where is that knocking coming from ?
what ’ s happening to me , that i ’ m frightened of every noise ?
i hear someone knocking at the south entry .
let ’ s go back to our bedroom .
a little water will wash away the evidence of our guilt .
it ’ s so simple !
you ’ ve lost your resolve .
listen !
there ’ s more knocking .
put on your nightgown , in case someone comes and sees that we ’ re awake .
snap out of your daze .
wake duncan with your knocking .
i wish you could !
knock , knock , knock !
knock , knock !
who ’ s there , in the other devil ’ s name ?
come on in , con man .
knock , knock , knock !
who ’ s there ?
maybe it ’ s an english tailor who liked to skimp on the fabric for people ’ s clothes .
come on in , tailor .
you can heat your iron up in here .
knock , knock !
never a moment of peace !
who are you ?
ah , this place is too cold to be hell .
i won ’ t pretend to be the devil ’ s porter anymore .
i ’ m coming , i ’ m coming !
please , don ’ t forget to leave me a tip .
did you go to bed so late , my friend , that you ’ re having a hard time getting up now ?
what three things does drink make a man do ?
it sets you up for a fall .
it persuades you and discourages you .
i believe drink did all of this to you last night .
is your master awake ?
our knocking woke him up .
here he comes .
good morning , noble sir .
good morning to both of you .
is the king awake , worthy thane ?
not yet .
he commanded me to wake him up early .
i ’ ve almost missed the time he requested .
i ’ ll bring you to him .
i know the burden of hosting him is both an honor and a trouble , but that doesn ’ t mean it ’ s not a trouble just the same .
the work we enjoy is not really work .
this is the door .
i ’ ll wake him , because that ’ s my job .
is the king leaving here today ?
he is .
he told us to arrange it .
the night has been chaotic .
the wind blew down through the chimneys where we were sleeping .
the owl made noise all night .
some people say that the earth shook as if it had a fever .
it was a rough night .
i ’ m too young to remember anything like it .
oh , horror , horror , horror !
this is beyond words and beyond belief !
what ’ s the matter ?
the worst thing imaginable has happened .
the life ” ?
do you mean the king ?
listen to this , king : as soon as we sent those irish soldiers running for cover , the norwegian king saw his chance to attack us with fresh troops and shiny weapons .
didn ’ t this frighten our captains , macbeth and banquo ?
the new challenge scared them about as much as sparrows frighten eagles , or rabbits frighten a lion .
to tell you the truth , they fought the new enemy with twice as much force as before ; they were like cannons loaded with double ammunition .
your words , like your wounds , bring you honor .
take him to the surgeons .
who is this ?
he looks like someone with a strange tale to tell .
go into the bedroom and see for yourself .
don ’ t ask me to talk about it .
go look and then do the talking yourselves .
wake up , wake up !
ring the alarm bell .
murder and treason !
banquo and donalbain , malcolm !
wake up !
shake off sleep , which looks like death , and look at death itself !
get up , get up , and look at this image of doomsday !
malcolm !
banquo !
get up from your beds as if you were rising out of your own graves , and walk like ghosts to come witness this horror .
speak up and tell me !
if i repeated it to you , it would kill you as soon as you heard it .
oh banquo , banquo , the king has been murdered !
how horrible !
what , in our own house ?
dear macduff , i beg you , tell us you were lying and say it isn ’ t so .
if i had only died an hour before this event i could say i had lived a blessed life .
everything is a sick joke .
the graceful and renowned king is dead .
the wine of life has been poured out , and only the dregs remain .
what ’ s wrong ?
you are , but you don ’ t know it yet .
the source from which your royal blood comes has been stopped .
your royal father is murdered .
who did it ?
it seems that the guards who were supposed to be protecting his chamber did it .
their hands and faces were all covered with blood .
so were their daggers , which we found on their pillows , unwiped .
they stared at us in confusion .
no one ’ s life should have been entrusted to them .
and yet i still regret the anger that drove me to kill them .
what did you do that for ?
is it possible to be wise , bewildered , calm , furious , loyal , and neutral all at once ?
then right next to him i saw the murderers , dripping with blood , their daggers rudely covered in gore .
who could have restrained himself , who loved duncan and had the courage to act on it ?
help me out of here , quickly !
take care of the lady .
right now we ’ re shaken up by fears and doubts .
i ’ m putting myself in god ’ s hands , and with his help i plan to fight against the secret plot that caused this treasonous murder .
so will i.
so will we all .
let ’ s get dressed quickly and then meet in the hall .
agreed .
what are you going to do ?
let ’ s not stay here with them .
it ’ s easy for a liar to pretend to feel sorrow when he actually feels none .
i ’ m going to england .
i ’ ll go to ireland .
we ’ ll both be safer if we go separate ways .
wherever we go , men will smile at us while hiding daggers .
our closest relatives are the ones most likely to murder us .
we haven ’ t yet encountered that danger , and the best thing to do is avoid it entirely .
there ’ s good reason to escape when there ’ s no mercy to be found anymore .
i can remember the past seventy years pretty well , and in all that time i have seen dreadful hours and strange things .
the clock says it ’ s daytime , but dark night is strangling the sun .
they say the horses ate each other .
i saw it with my own eyes .
here comes the good macduff .
how are things going now ?
can ’ t you see for yourself ?
the servants macbeth killed .
they were paid to betray their master .
malcolm and donalbain , the king ’ s two sons , have run away and fled , which makes them the prime suspects .
everything about this is unnatural !
then it looks like macbeth will become king .
he has already been named king and has left for scone to be crowned .
where is duncan ’ s body ?
it was carried to colmekill to be placed in the tomb of his ancestors , where their bones are kept safe .
are you going to scone ?
no , cousin , i ’ m going to fife .
well , i ’ ll go to scone .
i hope things go well there .
good-bye !
farewell , old man .
may god ’ s blessing go with you and with all who turn bad into good , and enemies into friends !
but it was also prophesied that the crown would not go to your descendants , and that my sons and grandsons would be kings instead .
if the witches tell the truth — which they did about you — maybe what they said about me will come true too .
but shhh !
i ’ ll shut up now .
whatever your highness commands me to do , it is always my duty to do it .
are you going riding this afternoon ?
yes , my good lord .
we would have liked to have heard your good advice , which has always been serious and helpful , at the council today , but we ’ ll wait until tomorrow .
are you riding far ?
i ’ m going far enough that i ’ ll be riding from now until dinner .
unless my horse goes faster than expected , i will be back an hour or two after sunset .
don ’ t miss our feast .
my lord , i won ’ t miss it .
but we can talk more about that tomorrow , when we ’ ll discuss matters of state that concern us both .
hurry up and get to your horse .
good-bye , until you return tonight .
is fleance going with you ?
yes , my good lord .
it ’ s time we hit the road .
farewell .
everybody may do as they please until seven o 'clock tonight .
in order to make your company even more enjoyable , i ’ m going to keep to myself until suppertime .
until then , god be with you !
bring them to me .
i ’ m very afraid of banquo .
he has the wisdom to act bravely but also safely .
i ’ m not afraid of anyone but him .
then , like prophets , they named him the father to a line of kings .
who ’ s there !
god save the king !
great happiness !
so now sweno , the norwegian king , wants a treaty .
we told him we wouldn ’ t even let him bury his men until he retreated to saint colme ’ s inch and paid us ten thousand dollars .
go announce that he will be executed , and tell macbeth that cawdor ’ s titles will be given to him .
i ’ ll get it done right away .
the thane of cawdor has lost what the noble macbeth has won .
now go to the door and stay there until i call for you .
wasn ’ t it just yesterday that we spoke to each other ?
it was yesterday , your highness .
well , did you think about what i said ?
i did that and more , which brings me to the point of this second meeting .
are you so patient and forgiving that you ’ re going to let him off the hook ?
are you so pious that you would pray for this man and his children , a man who has pushed you toward an early grave and put your family in poverty forever ?
we are men , my lord .
just as hounds and greyhounds , mongrels , spaniels , mutts , shaggy lapdogs , swimming dogs , and wolf-dog crossbreeds are all dogs .
it ’ s the same with men .
now , if you occupy some place in the list of men that isn ’ t down at the very bottom , tell me .
because if that ’ s the case , i will tell you a plan that will get rid of your enemy and bring you closer to me .
you both know banquo was your enemy .
it ’ s true , my lord .
we ’ ll do what you want us to , my lord .
though our lives — we have decided , my lord .
we ’ re in .
i ’ ll call for you soon .
stay inside .
the deal is closed .
banquo , if your soul is going to make it to heaven , tonight ’ s the night .
has banquo left the court ?
yes , madam , but he ’ ll be back tonight .
go tell the king i want to talk to him for a few minutes .
no problem , madam .
if you get what you want and you ’ re still not happy , you ’ ve spent everything and gained nothing .
it ’ s better to be the person who gets murdered than to be the killer and be tormented with anxiety .
what ’ s going on , my lord ?
what ’ s done is done .
we have slashed the snake but not killed it .
it will heal and be as good as new , and we ’ ll be threatened by its fangs once again .
we killed those men and sent them to rest in peace so that we could gain our own peace .
after that , nothing can hurt him further — not weapons , poison , rebellion , invasion , or anything else .
come on , relax , dear .
that ’ s exactly what i ’ ll do , my love , and i hope you ’ ll do the same .
you have to stop talking like this .
you know that banquo and his son fleance are still alive .
that ’ s comforting .
so be cheerful .
before the bat flies through the castle , and before the dung beetle makes his little humming noise to tell us it ’ s nighttime , a dreadful deed will be done .
what are you going to do ?
so i won ’ t choose what many men desire , because i won ’ t jump on the bandwagon and include myself with the whole crude population .
so i guess it ’ s you , you silver treasure house .
tell me once more what you say .
he who chooses me will get what he deserves . ” that ’ s nicely put — because who ’ s going to cheat luck and get more than he deserves ?
no one should have an honor he doesn ’ t deserve .
oh , wouldn ’ t it be great if property , rank , official positions , and other honors were earned only by merit , not by corruption ?
how many people who are humble now would be great then ?
how many noblemen would be weeded out and would become peasants ?
well , let me get back to my choice .
he who chooses me will get what he deserves . ” i ’ ll assume i deserve the very best . — give me a key for this one .
you thought about it too long , considering what you found there .
what ’ s this ?
i ’ ll read it . — it looks so unlike portia !
the one who chooses me will get what he deserves ” !
didn ’ t i deserve anything more than a fool ’ s head ?
is this my prize ?
don ’ t i deserve more than this ?
what does this say ?
this box was tested in the fire seven times .
some people kiss shadows .
they only feel the shadow of joy .
this choice was as foolish as they are .
take whatever wife you want to bed with you , you ’ ll have a fool ’ s head forever .
so go away .
i came here with a fool ’ s head on my shoulders and now i ’ m leaving with two . — goodbye , sweet lady .
i ’ ll keep my oath and patiently suffer through my anger .
this is how the candle burned the moth .
oh , these fools !
when they choose , they only know how to lose .
you know what they say .
destiny chooses when you ’ ll die and who you ’ ll marry .
come on , close the curtain , nerissa .
where ’ s lady portia ?
here .
how can i help you , sir ?
i haven ’ t seen such a promising candidate for your love .
please don ’ t tell me any more .
come on , nerissa , i want to go see this man who ’ s come so courteously .
so , what ’ s the news on the rialto ?
what are you saying ?
well , the point is , he ’ s lost a ship .
i hope that ’ s all he loses .
let me say “ amen ” quickly , before the devil comes in and stops my prayer — because here comes the devil , disguised as a jew .
how ’ s it going , shylock ?
what ’ s the news among the merchants ?
you knew — no one knew , no one knew as well as you did — about my daughter ’ s plans to run away .
that ’ s true .
i even knew the tailor who made the disguise she wore when she ran off .
she ’ ll be damned for it .
that ’ s true — if the devil ’ s judging her .
my own flesh and blood turned against me !
a rebel !
no !
your i mean my daughter is my flesh and blood .
but tell us , did you hear anything about antonio ’ s loss at sea ?
all right , we ’ ll see you at dinnertime .
i must be one of these silent so-called wise men gratiano ’ s talking about , because he never lets me get a word in .
if you hang around me for two more years , you ’ ll forget the sound of your own voice .
goodbye .
thank you .
is he right ?
gratiano talks more nonsense than any other man in venice .
you promised to tell me .
that ’ s another bad deal i ’ ve made ! — a bankrupt , a spendthrift , who now has to hide his head on the rialto , a beggar who used to look so smug in front of the other merchants .
let him think about his own debt .
he liked to call me a loan shark ; let him think about his debt to me .
he used to lend money as a favor between christians ; but now , let him think about his own debt .
but you won ’ t take his flesh if he can ’ t pay .
what ’ s that good for ?
i ’ ll use it for fish bait .
he ’ s laughed at my losses , made fun of my earnings , humiliated my race , thwarted my deals , turned my friends against me , riled up my enemies — and why ?
because i ’ m a jew .
doesn ’ t a jew have eyes ?
doesn ’ t a jew have hands , bodily organs , a human shape , five senses , feelings , and passions ?
doesn ’ t a jew eat the same food , get hurt with the same weapons , get sick with the same diseases , get healed by the same medicine , and warm up in summer and cool off in winter just like a christian ?
if you prick us with a pin , don ’ t we bleed ?
if you tickle us , don ’ t we laugh ?
if you poison us , don ’ t we die ?
and if you treat us badly , won ’ t we try to get revenge ?
if we ’ re like you in everything else , we ’ ll resemble you in that respect .
if a jew offends a christian , what ’ s the christian ’ s kind and gentle reaction ?
revenge .
we ’ ve been looking for him everywhere .
here comes another jew .
you couldn ’ t find a third like these two unless the devil himself turned into a jew .
hello , tubal .
any news from genoa ?
did you find my daughter ?
i went to many places where i heard news about her , but i couldn ’ t find her .
oh , oh , oh !
i never felt it until now — two thousand ducats in that diamond , and other precious , precious jewels !
i wish my daughter were dead at my feet wearing those jewels !
i wish she were in her coffin here , with the ducats in her coffin !
you couldn ’ t find out anything about them ?
why ?
i don ’ t even know how much i ’ m spending to find them .
loss upon loss !
well , other men have bad luck too .
antonio , as i heard in genoa — what , what , what ?
bad luck , bad luck ?
he ’ s had a ship wrecked coming from tripolis .
thank god , thank god !
is it true , is it true ?
i spoke with some of the sailors who survived the wreck .
thank you , tubal .
good news , good news !
ha , ha , heard in genoa .
i also heard that your daughter spent eighty ducats in genoa one night .
oh , you ’ re sticking a dagger in me !
i ’ ll never see my gold again .
eighty ducats in one shot !
eighty ducats !
i came to venice with a number of antonio ’ s creditors who say he won ’ t be able to avoid going bankrupt .
i ’ m very glad about that .
i ’ ll hound him .
i ’ ll torture him .
i ’ m very glad .
one creditor showed me a ring he got from your daughter in exchange for a monkey .
damn her !
you ’ re torturing me , tubal .
that was my turquoise ring !
leah gave it to me before we were married .
i wouldn ’ t have given it away for a whole jungle of monkeys .
but antonio ’ s certainly ruined .
that ’ s true , that ’ s very true .
with him out of venice , i can make whatever bargains i want when i lend money . — go , tubal .
meet me at the synagogue .
let me choose now .
i feel tortured by all this talking .
tortured ,
they ’ re as opposite as hot and cold .
promise me you ’ ll let me live , and i ’ ll confess the truth .
all right then , confess and live .
confess and love ” is more like it .
but let me try my luck on the boxes .
go ahead , then .
i ’ m locked in one of them .
if you really love me , you ’ ll find me . — nerissa and the rest of you , get away from him .
play some music while he chooses .
then if he loses , it ’ ll be his swan song , music before the end .
what music should we play then ?
we ’ ve all come out to see what will happen . — go , hercules !
if you survive , i ’ ll live .
i ’ m more anxious watching you fight than you are in the fight itself .
ding , dong , bell .
how many people are cowards at heart but wear beards like hercules or mars , the god of war ?
curly golden hair moves so nicely in the wind and makes a woman beautiful .
a lovely , cunning shore can distract a man from the perils of a stormy sea , just as a pretty scarf can hide a dangerous dark-skinned beauty .
so i ’ ll have nothing to do with that gaudy gold box — it ’ s like the gold that midas couldn ’ t eat .
since this prize is yours , be happy with it , and don ’ t look for a new one .
if you ’ re happy with what you ’ ve won and accept this prize as your blissful destiny , then turn to where your lady is , and claim her with a loving kiss . ”
a nice message .
my lady , with your permission , this note authorizes me to give myself to you with a kiss .
you see me standing here , lord bassanio .
i ’ m even happier that i ’ m not stupid , and i can learn .
i ’ m happiest of all that i ’ m yours now , my lord , my king , and you can guide me as you wish .
everything i am and everything i have now belongs to you .
just a minute ago i was the owner of this beautiful mansion , master of these servants , and queen over myself .
but as of right this second all these things are yours .
with this ring i give them all to you .
please let me know your plan , bassanio .
as long as it ’ s honorable , you can be sure that i ’ ll let you use all my money and do everything i can to help you .
back when i was a schoolboy , if i lost an arrow i would try to find it by shooting another arrow in the same direction , watching the second arrow more carefully than i had the first .
by risking the second arrow , i ’ d often get both of them back .
i ’ m telling you this story for a reason .
i owe you a lot , and like a spoiled kid i ’ ve lost what i owe you .
but if you ’ d be willing to shoot another arrow the same way you shot the first , i ’ ll watch your arrow more carefully this time .
just tell me what to do , and i ’ ll do it .
tell me .
if you see me without it , you can be confident i ’ m dead .
and when you get married , i hope i can be married at the same time .
absolutely , if you can find a wife by then .
i think i ’ ve found one already , thanks to you , my lord .
and do you mean what you ’ re saying , gratiano ?
yes , my lord .
hey , if i lay down my “ welcome , lorenzo and salerio .
i do too , my lord .
they ’ re entirely welcome .
that ’ s true , and with good reason .
this letter is for you from signor antonio .
before i open this letter , please tell me how my good friend is doing .
he ’ s not sick , my lord , but he ’ s very upset , and his problems are serious .
his letter will tell you how he ’ s doing .
i wish you ’ d won the something bad in that letter is making bassanio turn pale .
some good friend of his must have died , because nothing else in the world could change a man so much .
what , does the news only get worse ? — please , bassanio , i ’ m half of you , so let me bear half the burden this letter brings you .
oh portia , these are some of the worst words that ever stained a piece of paper .
my darling , when i gave my love to you , i told you that all the wealth i had ran within my veins — that i have noble blood , but no money .
when i said that , i told you the truth .
but my dear , when i said i was worth nothing , i was actually bragging — i should ’ ve said that i was worse than nothing .
have all his business ventures failed ?
not even one success ?
not one , my lord .
anyway , even if he had the money now , the jew probably wouldn ’ t take it .
i ’ ve never seen a creature with a human shape who was so eager to destroy a man .
he ’ s at the duke ’ s morning and night , accusing the state of harming free trade if they deny him justice .
when i was still living with him i heard him swear to tubal and cush , his countrymen , that he ’ d rather have antonio ’ s flesh than twenty times the sum antonio owed .
and i know that unless the law intervenes , it ’ ll be bad news for poor antonio .
is this your good friend who ’ s in so much trouble ?
how much does he owe the jew ?
three thousand ducats .
what , that ’ s all ?
pay him six thousand and cancel the debt .
i ’ ll give you enough gold to pay back your debt twenty times over .
when it ’ s paid , bring your friend back .
until you get back , nerissa and i will live like virgins and widows .
put on a happy face , and welcome your friends .
but let me hear the letter from your friend .
dear bassanio , my ships have all been wrecked .
my creditors are getting mean .
my money ’ s almost run out .
i couldn ’ t pay my debt to the jew on the due date .
in any case , do what you want .
if your affection for me doesn ’ t convince you to come , don ’ t let my letter do so . ” oh , my darling , make your arrangements and go !
since you ’ re letting me leave , i ’ ll hurry .
but i won ’ t sleep till i get back .
jailer , watch out for this one .
this is the fool who lent out money without charging interest .
jailer , keep an eye on him .
listen to me , good shylock .
i ’ m going to get my please , listen to me .
i want my bond .
i won ’ t listen to you .
i want my bond , so stop talking .
i won ’ t be taken for a fool who sighs and gives in to christian meddlers .
don ’ t follow me .
i ’ m not talking with you .
i want my bond .
he ’ s the most stubborn dog that ever lived among humans .
leave him alone .
i won ’ t follow him around with useless pleas anymore .
he wants me dead .
i know the real reason .
i ’ ve often given money to people who were unable to pay back their loans to him .
that ’ s why he hates me .
i ’ m sure the duke will never allow this contract to be enforced .
so go .
lorenzo , please take charge of the management of my house until my husband comes back .
madam , with all my heart .
i ’ ll do anything you ask .
they ’ ll consider you and jessica masters of this house in place of lord bassanio and myself .
so goodbye until we meet again .
goodbye , jessica .
now , balthazar , you ’ ve always been honest and faithful to me , and i trust you still are .
sometimes the expression on her face tells me she likes me .
her name is portia .
i ’ ll meet you at the ferry .
i ’ ll go as fast as i can , madam .
come on , nerissa , i have many things to do that you don ’ t even know about yet .
we ’ ll see our husbands before they even have a chance to miss us .
will they see us ?
they will , nerissa , but we ’ ll be disguised as men .
i ’ ll tell twenty lies like that , so men will think i graduated from school at least a year ago .
i know a thousand immature tricks like that , and i ’ ll use them all .
why , are we turning to men ?
what kind of question is that !
here , i ’ ll tell you my whole plan in my carriage , which is waiting for us at the gate .
so hurry up , because we have twenty miles to cover today .
yes , look , it ’ s true that children are punished for the sins of their fathers .
that ’ s why i ’ m worried about you .
i ’ ve always been straightforward with you , so now i ’ m telling you what i think .
cheer up , because i think you ’ re going to hell .
there ’ s only one hope for you , and even that ’ s a kind of illegitimate hope .
what hope is that , may i ask ?
you can hope your father isn ’ t your real father .
that really is an illegitimate hope .
then i ’ d be punished for the sins of my mother .
in that case i ’ m afraid you ’ re damned by both your father and your mother .
when you avoid one trap , you fall into another .
you ’ re in trouble either way .
my husband will save me .
he ’ s made me a christian .
he was wrong to do that .
there were enough christians before — as many of them as could stand to live near each other .
all these new christians will make the price of hogs go up .
if we ’ re all pork-eaters , we won ’ t be able to get our hands on a slice of bacon , even if we ’ ve got the money for it .
i ’ ll tell my husband what you ’ ve said , launcelot .
here he comes .
you ’ re going to make me jealous , launcelot , if you keep taking my wife into dark corners like this !
no , you don ’ t need to worry about us , lorenzo .
launcelot and i can ’ t agree on anything .
he says i won ’ t get into heaven because i ’ m a jew ’ s daughter , and he says you ’ re irresponsible because by converting jews to christianity you ’ re raising the price of pork .
i can justify that better than you can justify sleeping with portia ’ s african servant .
the it ’ s too bad there ’ s more of the moor than there ought to be .
i think the best sign of intelligence will soon be silence , and talking will only be a good thing for parrots to do .
that ’ s already been done , sir .
they ’ re all ready to eat dinner .
good lord , what a clown you are !
are you planning on showing me all your wit at once ?
about the table , sir , dinner will be served on it .
as for the food , it will be served in covered dishes .
as for your coming in to dinner , just do what you feel is right .
oh , he ’ s good at bending words around !
anyway , how are you , jessica ?
and how do you like lord bassanio ’ s wife ?
i like her more than i can say .
and if he doesn ’ t deserve this joy on earth , he ’ ll never deserve it in heaven .
the poor rude world doesn ’ t have her equal .
as good a wife as she is , that ’ s how good a husband i am to you .
first let ’ s go to dinner .
no , let me say some good things about you while i ’ m in the mood .
no , please , save it for dinner conversation .
is antonio here ?
yes , sir , i ’ m here .
i feel sorry for you .
you ’ ve come to face a ruthless enemy , an inhuman wretch incapable of pity , without any feelings of mercy .
they tell me you ’ ve done everything you can to talk him out of what he ’ s doing .
i ’ m ready to suffer peacefully whatever he does to me in his cruelty and anger .
one of you go call the jew into court here .
he ’ s standing ready outside the door .
here he comes , my lord .
we all expect a nice answer from you , jew .
i ’ ve told you what i intend to do , and i ’ ve sworn by the holy sabbath to seek the penalty that is due according to our contract .
if you refuse to allow me to do so , your city ’ s charter and its freedom are endangered .
you ’ re going to ask me why i ’ d rather have a pound of decaying flesh than three thousand ducats .
i won ’ t answer that .
is that enough of an answer ?
what if i had a rat in my house , and i felt like paying ten thousand ducats to have it exterminated ?
do you have your answer yet ?
some men don ’ t like roast pig , others go crazy if they see a cat , and others can ’ t help urinating when they hear bagpipes .
so , to answer your question .
it doesn ’ t excuse your cruel behavior .
i don ’ t have to give you answers that you like .
does everyone kill what they don ’ t love ?
what , would you let a snake bite you twice ?
you might as well do the impossible rather than try to soften his jewish heart .
i would choose to take my penalty .
how can you ever hope for mercy for yourself , when you don ’ t give any now ?
why should i be afraid of your judgment when i haven ’ t done anything wrong ?
many of you own slaves , which — like your donkeys and dogs and mules — you use to perform awful jobs just because you bought them .
should i say to you , “ set them free !
let them marry your children !
why are you making them work so hard ?
let their beds be as soft as yours , and let them eat the same food as you ” ?
no , you ’ d answer , “ the slaves are ours . ” and that ’ s just how i ’ m answering you .
the pound of flesh that i want from him was very expensive .
it ’ s mine and i ’ m going to get it .
if you refuse me , the laws of venice have no validity .
i await justice .
oh nerissa , my poor little body is tired of this great big world .
but as far as i can tell , people with too much suffer as much as people with nothing .
the best way to be happy is to be in between .
good point , and well said .
it would be better if you actually applied it to your life .
it takes a good priest to practice what he preaches .
but thinking like this won ’ t help me choose a husband .
isn ’ t it a pain that i can ’ t choose or refuse anyone , nerissa ?
i have the authority to dismiss this court , unless bellario comes today .
bring us the letters .
call the messenger in .
cheer up , antonio !
keep up your courage , man !
i ’ ll give the jew my flesh , blood , bones , and everything before you lose one drop of blood for me .
i ’ m like the one sick sheep in the flock , the one who deserves to die .
the weakest fruit drops to the ground first , so let me drop .
bassanio , the best thing you can do is to keep living and write an epitaph for my gravestone .
have you come from bellario ’ s office in padua ?
yes , my lord .
bellario sends his greetings .
to cut my penalty from that bankrupt man over there .
you ’ re sharpening that knife not on your sole but on your soul , you cruel jew .
no metal — not even the executioner ’ s axe — could ever be half as sharp as your hatred .
can ’ t any prayers reach your heart ?
no , none that you ’ re smart enough to make .
you make me want to agree with the philosopher pythagoras that animal souls are reincarnated in human bodies .
that ’ s why your desires are wolfish , bloody , and ravenous .
unless your taunts can undo the signature on my contract , you ’ re just wearing out your lungs by speaking so loud .
be quiet , boy , or you ’ ll lose your mind .
i stand here with the law on my side .
this letter from bellario introduces us to a young and well-educated legal expert .
where is he ?
he ’ s waiting nearby to find out if you ’ ll invite him in .
with all my heart . — three or four of you go welcome him . — in the meantime , i ’ ll read bellario ’ s letter out loud .
his name is balthazar .
i leave him to you .
did old bellario send you here ?
yes , my lord .
welcome .
please have a seat .
are you familiar with the case currently before the court ?
yes , thoroughly .
antonio and shylock , both of you come forward .
is your name shylock ?
shylock is my name .
your case is most unusual , though the venetian law can ’ t stop you from proceeding . — yes , so he says .
do you acknowledge the contract ?
yes , i do .
then the jew must show you mercy .
why do i have to do that ?
tell me .
no one shows mercy because he has to .
it just happens , the way gentle rain drops on the ground .
it blesses the one who gives it and the one who receives it .
it ’ s strongest in the strongest people .
it looks better in a king than his own crown looks on him .
kingly power seems most like god ’ s power when the king mixes mercy with justice .
if you pursue it , this strict court of venice will need to carry out the sentence against the merchant there .
i take all responsibility for my decisions .
i want the law , the penalty , and the fulfillment of my contract .
can ’ t he pay back the money ?
if that ’ s not enough , i ’ ll sign a contract to pay ten times that much , and i ’ ll give you my hands , my head , and my heart as security .
there ’ s no power in venice that can change an established decree .
the change will be recorded as a precedent , and many bad legal decisions will result .
that can ’ t happen .
please , let me review the contract .
shylock , they ’ re offering you three times the money you lent .
but i made an oath , an oath , an oath in heaven .
should i perjure my soul by disobeying it ?
no , not for all of venice .
and so the jew may lawfully claim a pound of flesh nearest the merchant ’ s heart , to be cut off by him . — but please have mercy .
take three times your money .
tell me to tear up this contract .
i ’ ll tear it up when it ’ s paid .
you seem like a good judge .
you know the law .
i urge you to deliver your verdict .
i swear that nothing anyone can say will change my mind .
i ’ m sticking to the contract .
i beg the court to deliver the verdict .
well , then , here it is : you must prepare yourself for his knife .
oh , good judge !
oh , you excellent young man !
the law fully authorizes the penalty , which you have to pay according to the contract .
very true .
oh wise judge !
you ’ re so much older than you look !
yes , his chest !
nearest his heart . ” — those are the very words .
yes .
is there a scale here to weigh the flesh ?
i have it ready .
pay a surgeon to stand by and bind his wounds , shylock , so he doesn ’ t bleed to death .
is that called for in the contract ?
not explicitly , but so what ?
it wouldn ’ t hurt you to be charitable .
i can ’ t find it .
it ’ s not in the contract .
not much .
i ’ m ready and waiting . — give me your hand , bassanio .
goodbye .
don ’ t be sad that this happened because of you , because lady luck ’ s been nicer to me than usual .
be sad only at the fact that you ’ ll lose your friend — your friend doesn ’ t regret that he paid your debt .
if the jew cuts deep enough , i ’ ll pay it instantly with all my heart .
antonio , i married a woman as dear to me as life itself .
but life itself , my wife , and the whole world aren ’ t more valuable to me than your life is .
i ’ d give it all up — yes , i ’ d sacrifice them all to this devil here — to save you .
your wife wouldn ’ t like it if she were here to hear you make that offer .
i have a wife i love .
i wish she were in heaven so she could appeal to some power to make this dog jew change his mind .
it ’ s nice you ’ re offering to sacrifice her behind her back .
that ’ s what you get for marrying christian husbands .
i have a daughter .
the court awards it and the law authorizes it .
what a righteous judge !
and you have to cut this flesh from his chest .
the law allows it , and the court awards it .
what a wise judge !
come on , get ready .
but wait a moment .
there ’ s something else .
this contract doesn ’ t give you any blood at all .
is that the law ?
you can see for yourself .
you asked for justice , so rest assured you ’ ll get more justice than you bargained for .
pay me three times the amount of the loan and let the christian go .
here is the money .
wait !
the jew will have justice .
wait , don ’ t rush !
he ’ s not getting anything except the penalty .
so get ready to cut off the flesh .
don ’ t shed any blood , or cut less or more than exactly a pound of flesh .
a second daniel ! — a daniel , jew !
i ’ ve got you now , pagan .
why is the jew waiting ?
take your penalty .
give me my money and let me go .
i have it ready for you .
here it is .
your father was an extremely moral man , and religious people get odd ideas on their deathbeds .
but tell me .
well , first there was the prince from naples .
i ’ m afraid his mother may have had an affair with a blacksmith .
then there ’ s the count palatine .
he does nothing but frown , as if he wants to say , “ if you don ’ t want me , i don ’ t care . ” he doesn ’ t even smile when he hears funny stories .
if he ’ s so sad and solemn when he ’ s young , i can only imagine how much he ’ ll cry as an old man .
no , i ’ d rather be married to a skull with a bone in its mouth than to either of those men .
god protect me from these two !
what did you think about that french lord , monsieur le bon ?
no , he refused it publicly , in open court .
he will have only justice and his penalty .
you can ’ t have anything but the penalty , to be taken at your peril , jew .
well , then , i hope he chokes on it !
i ’ m not staying here to argue anymore .
wait a minute , jew .
the law has another hold on you .
the laws of venice state that if a foreign resident directly or indirectly attempts to kill any citizen , the person he tried to kill will receive one half of the foreigner ’ s goods .
the other half goes to the state .
so get down on your knees and beg mercy from the duke .
so you ’ ll be hanged at the state ’ s expense .
i want you to see the difference between us , so i pardon you even before you ask for a pardon .
half of your wealth goes to antonio .
the other half goes to the state .
yes , the state ’ s half can be reduced , but not antonio ’ s .
no , go ahead and take my life .
don ’ t pardon that .
you take my house away when you take the money i need for upkeep .
you take my life when you take away my means of making a living .
what mercy can you show him , antonio ?
nothing else , for god ’ s sake !
second , he must make a will here in this court that leaves all his property to his son-in-law lorenzo and his daughter when he dies .
he must do this , or i ’ ll recant the pardon i just delivered .
are you satisfied , jew ?
what do you say ?
i ’ m satisfied .
please let me go .
i ’ m not well .
send the deed after me and i ’ ll sign it .
go , but sign the deed .
i should really leave right away .
i ’ m sorry you don ’ t have time . — antonio , give this gentleman a reward .
we owe you love and service forever .
being satisfied with a job well done is payment enough .
in saving you i consider myself well paid .
my thoughts were never on money .
i hope you ’ ll recognize me when we meet again .
i wish you well .
take some memento from us as a token of our gratitude , not as a fee .
this ring , sir — oh no , it ’ s nothing .
i ’ d be ashamed to give you this .
i don ’ t want anything but that .
now that i think about it , i really want it .
there ’ s more to this ring than its cash value .
i ’ ll give you the most expensive ring in venice , and i ’ ll make a public announcement to help me find it .
but as for this ring , please excuse me .
i see you like to make big offers , sir .
first you taught me how to beg , and now i think you ’ re teaching me how a beggar should be answered .
good sir , this ring was given to me by my wife .
when she put it on my finger , she made me swear never to sell it , give it away , or lose it .
many men use that excuse to avoid giving gifts .
if your wife ’ s not a madwoman , and you tell her how much i deserve this ring , she won ’ t stay angry at you forever if you give it to me .
well , anyway , goodbye .
bassanio , let him have the ring .
come on , you and i will go soon .
early in the morning we ’ ll both rush to belmont .
come on , antonio .
find out where the jew ’ s house is .
give him this deed and have him sign it .
we ’ ll leave tonight and be home a day before our husbands get back .
lorenzo will be happy with what we ’ ve done .
and could you please take my servant to old shylock ’ s house ?
i ’ ll do that .
go , hurry .
you know where i ’ ll be waiting .
the moon ’ s bright tonight .
i think that on a night like this , when the wind blew the trees so gently that they didn ’ t make a sound , on a night like this , on a night like this , on a night like this ,
on a night like this , young lorenzo swore he loved her very much , stealing her heart with vows of love , but not one vow was true .
on a night like this , pretty jessica , in a bad mood , said outrageously wrong things about her lover , and he forgave her .
i hear his footsteps .
who are you , coming so fast in this quiet night ?
a friend .
a friend ?
what friend ?
what ’ s your name , please , friend ?
my name ’ s stephano , and i ’ ve come to tell you my mistress will arrive here at belmont before sunrise .
she ’ s still at the monastery , kneeling and praying for a happy marriage .
who ’ s coming with her ?
no one except her maid and a holy hermit .
has my master returned yet ?
hey , hey !
hey !
yoo-hoo !
who ’ s shouting ?
hey !
have you seen master lorenzo !
stop hollering , man !
i ’ m here .
hey !
where , where ?
here .
tell him a messenger has arrived from my master with good news .
my master will be here in the morning .
my dear , let ’ s go inside and wait for them to arrive .
but i guess it doesn ’ t matter .
we might as well call him a man , since god created him .
his horse is better than the neapolitan ’ s and he frowns more than the count palatine .
what about falconbridge , that young english baron ?
i have no opinion about him .
he doesn ’ t speak latin , french , or italian , and you know how little english i speak .
he ’ s great-looking , but how can you talk to someone who doesn ’ t speak your language ?
he was dressed so oddly too !
i think he got his jacket in italy , his tights in france , his hat in germany , and his behavior everywhere .
what do you think of his neighbor , the scottish lord ?
how beautiful the moonlight ’ s shining on this bank !
let ’ s sit here and let the music fill our ears .
stillness and nighttime are perfect for beautiful music .
sit down , jessica .
look at the stars , see how the floor of heaven is inlaid with small disks of bright gold .
wake up the moon goddess with a hymn !
get her attention and draw her home with music .
i ’ m never in the mood to laugh when i hear sweet music .
his soul is as dull as night and dark as the underworld .
nobody like that should be trusted .
pay attention to the music .
that light we see is coming from my hall .
look how far that little candle sends its light !
that ’ s the way a good deed shines in a naughty world .
while the moon was shining we didn ’ t even notice the candle .
well , brighter lights always dim the smaller ones .
a governor shines as brightly as a king until a king is near by , and the governor suddenly looks like a nobody .
music , listen !
it ’ s your music , madam , from your house .
now i see that you can ’ t call anything good except in right context .
how many things in life seem good to us because of when they happen !
quiet now !
look how the moon seems to be sleeping with its lover and can ’ t be awoken !
if i ’ m not mistaken , that ’ s portia ’ s voice .
he recognizes me like a blind man recognizes a cuckoo — by its bad voice .
dear lady , welcome home .
we ’ ve been praying for our husbands ' welfare .
have they come back ?
go inside , nerissa .
tell my servants not to mention that we were gone .
i hear his trumpet .
i think this night is just like sick daylight .
it only looks a little paler .
it looks like a day when the sun is hidden .
i ’ ll give thank you , darling .
i ’ d like to introduce you to my friend .
this is antonio , my dearest friend .
sir , welcome to our house .
but action speaks louder than words , so i ’ ll cut short these polite words .
what , an argument already ?
what ’ s the matter ?
it said , “ love me and don ’ t leave me . ” how can you talk about the quality of the poem or the value of the ring ?
you swore to me when i gave it to you that you would wear it till you died , and that it would be buried with you .
and now you claim you gave it to a judge ’ s clerk !
he will if he lives long enough to become a man .
yes , if a woman grows up to be a man .
i didn ’ t have the heart to say no to him .
you were wrong to give away your wife ’ s first gift so thoughtlessly , a thing you swore to keep on your finger and bound faithfully to your body .
i gave my lover a ring and made him swear never to lose it or give it away .
and here he is .
i ’ d swear he wouldn ’ t leave it behind , or even take it off his finger , for all the money in the world .
to tell the truth , gratiano , you ’ re giving your wife a valid reason to get upset .
if it were me , i ’ d be very upset too .
bassanio gave his ring to the judge who asked for it , and deserved it too .
and then his clerk , who went to a lot of trouble with the writing , begged for mine .
neither of them would take anything but the two rings .
which ring did you give away , my lord ?
not the one i gave you , i hope .
if i could make things better by lying , i ’ d deny it .
but you see my finger doesn ’ t have the ring on it .
it ’ s gone .
if you ’ d known how much that ring meant , how much the woman who gave it to you is worth , or how much your honor depended on your keeping the ring , you wouldn ’ t have let it go .
nerissa ’ s got the right idea .
i ’ ll bet my life you gave some woman the ring !
what could i say , my dear ?
i had to send it to him .
don ’ t let that lawyer ever come near my house !
since he has the jewel i loved , which you swore you ’ d keep forever , i ’ ll be as generous as you were to him .
i won ’ t deny him anything of mine , including my own body and my husband ’ s bed .
i ’ ll recognize him all right , i ’ m sure of it .
so don ’ t spend one night away from this house .
watch me like a hawk .
if you don ’ t , if i ’ m left alone , i swear i ’ ll have that legal expert as my bedfellow .
all these quarrels are about me .
don ’ t be upset .
all these friends are my witnesses , so i swear to you , i swear by your beautiful eyes , in which i see myself reflected — did you hear that !
he sees himself in my two eyes , so there ’ s two of him .
he should swear by his two-faced self , and that ’ s an oath i ’ ll believe !
no , just listen to me .
if you forgive my mistake , i swear i ’ ll never break an oath with you again .
i lent my body once to make him rich .
my god , it ’ s the same one i gave the judge !
i got it from him .
what , did you cheat on us before we deserved it ?
don ’ t be crass . — you all look confused .
i ’ m speechless .
yes , but the clerk will never do it , unless he grows up to be a man .
madam , you ’ ve given me life and given me a living too .
how did you like the young german , the duke of saxony ’ s nephew ?
he ’ s pretty awful in the morning when he ’ s sobering up , and even worse in the afternoon when he ’ s drunk .
at his best he ’ s a little less than a man , and at his worst he ’ s little more than an animal .
i ’ ll do anything rather than marry a drunk , nerissa .
you don ’ t have to worry about any of these lords , my lady .
i wish them all safe trips home .
do you remember a venetian scholar and soldier who accompanied the marquess of montferrat here once when your father was still alive ?
how are you , lorenzo ?
my clerk has some comforting news for you , too .
yes , and i ’ ll give it to him for free .
ladies , you ’ re dropping bread from the heavens to starving people .
it ’ s almost morning , but i ’ m sure you ’ re not fully satisfied about what happened .
let ’ s go inside and we ’ ll answer all your questions truthfully .
all right , then .
my first question for nerissa is whether she ’ d rather wait till tomorrow night or go to bed now , since there are only two more hours till morning .
when the day comes , i ’ ll wish it were nighttime , so i could sleep with the legal expert ’ s clerk .
yes , madam , that ’ s the one .
he deserves a beautiful wife more than all the other men i ’ ve ever seen .
i remember him well , and my memory tells me that he deserves your praise .
hello , do you have any news ?
the four suitors are looking for you so they can say goodbye , madam .
and there ’ s a messenger representing a fifth one , the prince of morocco , who says the prince will be here tonight .
if i could say hello to the fifth one as happily as i ’ ll say goodbye to the first four , i ’ d be very happy he ’ s coming .
if he ’ s as good as a saint but is black like a devil , i ’ d rather he hear my confession than marry me .
let ’ s go , nerissa . —
three thousand ducats , hmmm .
yes , for three months .
for three months , hmmm .
as i said before , antonio will guarantee the loan .
if i default , he ’ ll pay you .
antonio will guarantee it , hmmm .
can you help me ?
what ’ s your answer ?
three thousand ducats for three months , and antonio will guarantee it .
your answer ?
antonio ’ s a good man .
have you heard anything to the contrary ?
but his investments are uncertain right now .
he has one ship bound for tripoli , another heading for the indies .
what ’ s more , people at the
but ships are just fragile boards , and sailors are just men .
there are rats and thieves and pirates — not to mention storms , winds , and rocks .
but in spite of all this , the man is still wealthy enough .
i assure you he can .
oh yes — to smell this is signor antonio .
to be honest , i don ’ t know why i ’ m so sad .
i ’ m tired of it , and you say you ’ re tired of it too .
i ’ d be peering over maps to figure out the best ports , piers , and waterways .
everything that made me worry about my ships would make me sad .
shylock , are you listening ?
if i remember correctly , i can ’ t raise the entire three thousand ducats immediately .
but so what ?
tubal , a wealthy jew i know , will supply me with the cash .
but wait a minute !
how many months do you want ?
shylock , although i never lend or borrow with interest , i ’ m willing to break that habit to help a friend in need .
oh yes , three thousand ducats .
for three months .
yes , i forgot — three months .
that ’ s right .
that ’ s not how i do business .
when jacob took care of his uncle laban ’ s sheep — jacob was the heir to his grandfather abraham ’ s birthright , because his mother cleverly arranged for her husband isaac to make jacob his heir — what ’ s your point ?
did he charge interest ?
jacob didn ’ t have any control over what happened .
that your interest payments are like jacob ’ s sheep ?
but listen to me , signor —
an evil soul using a holy story is like a criminal who smiles at you .
oh , liars can look so honest !
three months from twelve months of the year .
let me see .
the interest rate will be — well , shylock ?
signor antonio , you ’ ve often insulted my money and my business practices in the rialto .
and all because i use my own money to make a profit .
and now it looks like you need my help .
all right then .
you come to me saying , “ shylock , we need money . ” you say that ! — even though you spat on my beard and kicked me like you ’ d kick a stray mutt out your front door .
and now you ’ re asking for money .
what can i tell you ?
shouldn ’ t i say , “ does a dog have money ?
is it possible for a mutt to lend three thousand ducats ? ” or should i bend down low , and in a humble and submissive voice say :
if you ’ re going to lend us this money , don ’ t lend it to us as if we were your friends .
instead , lend it to me as your enemy .
look at you getting all riled up !
i want to be friends with you , and forget all the times you ’ ve embarrassed and humiliated me .
i ’ m making a kind offer — zero percent financing .
that really would be kind .
i ’ ll show you how kind i am .
it ’ s a deal .
i ’ ll agree to those terms and even say that jews are nice .
no , you can ’ t sign a contract like that for me !
i ’ d rather go without the money .
in two months — a month before this loan is due — i expect to earn more than three times that much from my investments .
a pound of human flesh taken isn ’ t even as valuable as a pound of mutton or beef .
if he agrees , great .
if not , goodbye .
and i hope you won ’ t think badly of me .
yes , shylock , i ’ ll sign the contract and agree to its terms .
then meet me right away at the notary ’ s .
give him the instructions for our amusing little contract , and i ’ ll go get the money for you right away .
hurry up , my jewish friend .
my ships will come home a month before the money is due .
i wouldn ’ t change it except to make you think of me , my darling queen .
thank you for saying that .
show me the caskets and let me try my luck .
but this is bad !
think about it carefully .
let me take my chances .
let ’ s go to the temple first .
you can take your chances after dinner .
i ’ m sure i ’ ll feel guilty if i run away from this jew , my master .
anyway , my conscience says , “ stay put . ” “ go , ” the devil says .
don ’ t go , ” says my conscience .
but if i ran away from the jew , i ’ d be following the advice of the devil , who ’ s the very devil himself .
the devil ’ s advice is nicer .
i ’ ll run , devil .
tell me to run , and i ’ ll run .
excuse me , young man , how do i get to the jew ’ s residence ?
young man , excuse me , how do i get to the jew ’ s ?
turn right at the next turn , but at the following turn , turn left .
oh , and then at the very next turn , don ’ t turn left or right , but turn down and around to the jew ’ s house .
good heavens , those are difficult directions .
can you tell me if a man named launcelot , who lives with him , is still there ?
are you talking about young master launcelot ?
he ’ s not a “ master , ” sir , he ’ s just a poor man ’ s son .
his father , if i do say so myself , is an honest but very poor man , and , thank god , likely to live a long time .
he ’ s just launcelot .
who wouldn ’ t get sad thinking about things like that ?
it ’ s obvious .
no , that ’ s not it , trust me .
so it ’ s not my business that ’ s making me sad .
well then , you must be in love .
you ’ re not in love either ?
but excuse me , yes , i ’ m talking about launcelot , sir .
oh , no .
god forbid !
the boy was going to support me in my old age !
what am i , a cane ?
don ’ t you recognize me , father ?
heaven help me , i don ’ t know you , sir .
but please tell me , is my boy — god rest his soul — alive or dead ?
you really don ’ t recognize me , father ?
sir , i ’ m half-blind .
i don ’ t know you .
even if you had your eyes , you still might not recognize me .
it takes a wise father to know his own child .
well , old man , i ’ ll tell you news of your son .
give me your blessing .
please stand up !
i ’ m sure you aren ’ t launcelot , my boy .
give me your blessing .
i ’ m launcelot , who was your boy , is your son , and will be your child .
i can ’ t believe you ’ re my son .
yes , you ’ re right , her name is margery .
if you ’ re launcelot , then you ’ re my own flesh and blood .
then dobbin ’ s tail must be growing backward .
i ’ m sure he had more hair on his tail than i have on my face when i last saw him .
lord , how you ’ ve changed !
how are you and your master getting along ?
i ’ ve brought him a present .
how are you ?
my master ’ s a total jew .
you ’ re giving him a present ?
give him a noose to hang himself .
he ’ s starving me to death .
you can see my ribs so well you can count them .
i ’ m glad you ’ ve come , father .
give me your present to give to master bassanio .
thank you .
what do you want with me ?
what do you want ?
to work for you , sir .
that ’ s what we ’ re trying to say , sir .
i know who you are .
you can have what you want .
father , go ahead .
bassanio please , leonardo , think about this i ’ ll do my best .
he ’ s walking over there , sir .
signor bassanio !
gratiano !
i have a favor to ask .
anything .
don ’ t say no .
let me go with you to belmont .
well , if you have to go , you have to go .
but listen to me , gratiano .
sometimes you get a bit too wild , and you let your voice get a bit loud and rude .
please , try to act a little more serious , or the people in belmont will get the wrong impression about me , and your wildness will make me blow my chance with portia .
listen , signor bassanio , there ’ s nothing to worry about .
i ’ ll carry prayer books in my pocket and look sweet — even more .
if i don ’ t do all this , never trust me again .
well , we ’ ll see how you act .
okay , but tonight doesn ’ t count .
you can ’ t judge me based on what i do tonight .
i ’ d rather see you having fun , because we have friends coming who want to have fun .
anyway , i have to say goodbye to you now .
i ’ ve got some business to take care of .
i ’ m sorry you ’ re leaving my father like this .
it ’ s hell in our house , and you helped cheer it up , like a funny devil .
you ’ ll soon be meeting lorenzo at supper ; he ’ ll be a guest of your new master .
give him this letter .
goodbye .
i ’ m sure some christian will resort to trickery to get you .
but goodbye .
it ’ s not manly to cry .
goodbye .
goodbye , launcelot .
oh god , what a heinous sinner i am , being ashamed to be my father ’ s child !
but i need to remember i ’ m related to him by blood , not behavior .
oh lorenzo , if you keep your promise to me , i ’ ll end this agony by becoming a christian and marrying you .
no , we ’ ll sneak away at supper time , disguise ourselves with masks at my house , and come back in an hour .
but we haven ’ t made any preparations .
we haven ’ t even talked about who ’ ll be our torchbearers .
i think it ’ s better to call it off .
it ’ s only four o 'clock now .
we have two hours to get ready .
launcelot , what ’ s going on ?
i recognize the handwriting .
i bet it ’ s a love letter !
where are you going ?
to invite my former boss , the jew , to dine tonight with my new master , the christian .
me too .
meet me and gratiano at his house in about an hour .
it ’ s good we ’ re doing this .
wasn ’ t that letter from jessica ?
some people will laugh at anything , and others are so grouchy they won ’ t even crack a smile when they hear something hysterically funny .
goodbye , then .
you ’ re both very precious to me .
you need to leave to take care of your own business .
we ’ re available .
bassanio , we ’ ll say goodbye for now , since you ’ ve found antonio .
don ’ t worry , i ’ ll be there .
i have to tell you everything .
who asked you to call her ?
i ’ m not asking you to call her .
you always loved to tell me i couldn ’ t do anything without being told .
did you call me ?
do you need something ?
i ’ ve been invited to supper , jessica .
here are my keys . — but why should i go ?
i wasn ’ t invited because they like me .
they ’ re just flattering me .
but i ’ ll go out of spite , to feed off the wasteful christian . — jessica , my girl , watch the house .
i don ’ t feel like going .
i know because i dreamed of money bags last night .
please go , sir .
my new master is expecting your approach .
and i ’ m expecting his reproach .
and they ’ ve been plotting things together .
what , there ’ s going to be a masquerade ?
don ’ t stick your head out into the public street to stare at the christian fools with painted faces .
block up my house ’ s ears — i mean the windows .
i ’ ll go ahead of you , sir .
what did that gentile fool say to you , hmmm ?
he said “ goodbye , madam , ” and nothing else .
the fool ’ s nice enough , but he ’ s such a huge eater , and slow as a snail when he works .
he sleeps all day like a cat .
anyway , jessica , go inside .
i might come back soon .
do as i told you .
shut the doors after you .
goodbye .
if luck ’ s with me , i ’ ll lose a father , and you ’ ll lose a daughter .
this is the roof under which lorenzo said to meet him .
he ’ s late .
yes , and that ’ s surprising , because lovers are usually early .
yes , for new lovers time passes ten times faster than for couples who ’ ve been married forever .
that ’ s always true .
who gets up from a meal with the same appetite he had when he sat down ?
can any horse retrace his footsteps with the same energy he had when he walked them the first time ?
we chase everything in life more excitedly than we actually enjoy it when we get it .
here comes lorenzo .
we ’ ll talk about this later .
my dear friends , thanks for your patience .
i had business that made me late .
when you have to steal your own wives some day , i ’ ll wait for you just as long .
come over here .
who ’ s in there ?
who are you ?
tell me so i can be sure , though i swear i recognize your voice .
i ’ m lorenzo , your love .
lorenzo , that ’ s for sure , and i ’ m also sure you ’ re my love — who else do i love so much ?
and now who but you knows whether i ’ m yours ?
as god is my witness , you know you ’ re mine .
here , catch this box .
it ’ ll be worth your while .
you have to be my torchbearer for the masquerade .
what , i have to hold a candle up so people can see what i ’ m doing ?
i ’ ll lock up the doors , grab some more ducats , and be with you right away .
my god , she can ’ t be a jew , she ’ s too nice !
god , i ’ m crazy about her .
she ’ s wise , if i ’ m judging her right .
she ’ s beautiful , if my eyes can see .
and she ’ s loyal , as she has proven .
and as long as she ’ s herself — wise , beautiful , and faithful — she ’ ll always have a place in my heart .
ah , you ’ re here ? — come on , gentlemen , let ’ s go !
our masquerade mates are waiting for us .
who ’ s there ?
signor antonio ?
it ’ s nine o 'clock !
our friends are all waiting for you .
there ’ s no masquerade tonight .
i ’ ve sent twenty people to look for you .
i ’ m glad .
i want to head out tonight .
one of them contains my picture .
if you choose that one , i ’ m yours , along with the picture .
i wish some god could help me choose !
let me see .
i ’ ll look over the inscriptions again .
what does the lead box say ?
he who chooses me must give and risk all he has . ” must give everything — for what ?
for lead ?
risk everything for lead ?
this box is too threatening .
men who risk everything hope to make profits .
a golden mind doesn ’ t bend down to choose something worthless .
so i won ’ t give or risk anything for lead .
what does the silver one say ?
he who chooses me will get as much as he deserves . ” as much as he deserves — wait a minute there , morocco , and consider your own value with a level head .
what if i went no further and chose this one ?
but let ’ s see once more what the gold one says : “ he who chooses me will get what many men want . ” that ’ s portia !
the whole world wants her .
they come from the four corners of the earth to kiss this shrine and see this living , breathing saint .
princes travel across deserts and the vast wilderness of arabia to come see the beautiful portia .
the wide ocean doesn ’ t prevent them from coming to see her — they travel across it as if it were a little stream .
one of these three boxes contains her lovely picture .
could the lead one contain it ?
no , it ’ d be a sin to think such a low thought .
lead ’ s too crass to hold her .
is she enclosed in silver , which is ten times less valuable than gold ?
oh , what a sinful thought !
nobody ever set a gem like her in a worse setting than gold .
they have a coin in england stamped with the figure of an angel , but that ’ s just engraved on the surface .
you don ’ t look well , antonio .
people with too much invested in the world always get hurt .
i ’ d rather overload my liver with wine than starve my heart by denying myself fun .
i ’ ll talk to you more about this some other time .
i ’ m a fool . — let ’ s go , lorenzo . — goodbye for now .
i ’ ll finish my lecture after dinner .
here an angel ’ s lying in a golden bed . — give me the key .
i will choose this one and try my chances .
damn it !
what ’ s this ?
it ’ s a skull with a scroll in its empty eye socket .
i ’ ll read it aloud .
all that glitters is not gold — you ’ ve often heard that said .
many men have sold their souls just to view my shiny surface .
but gilded tombs contain worms .
if you ’ d been as wise as you were bold , with an old man ’ s mature judgment , you wouldn ’ t have had to read this scroll .
portia , goodbye to you .
my heart ’ s too sad for long goodbyes .
losers always leave quickly .
good riddance ! — close the curtains and leave . — i hope everyone who looks like him will make the same choice .
i saw bassanio sail away , and gratiano went with him .
i ’ m sure lorenzo isn ’ t on their ship .
that wicked jew got the duke to listen to his complaints .
the duke went with him to search bassanio ’ s ship .
he got there too late .
the ship was already sailing .
but once he got there , the duke learned that lorenzo and his lover jessica were together in a gondola .
in any case , antonio assured the duke they weren ’ t with bassanio on his ship .
i ’ ve never heard such confused emotions as what that jew dog was shouting in the streets .
ran off with a christian !
oh my christian ducats !
justice , find the girl !
she has the stones on her , and the ducats . ” i know , all the boys in venice are following him , yelling , “ his stones , his daughter , and his ducats ! ”
i hope antonio repays his loan on time , or he ’ ll suffer for this .
that ’ s a good point .
i spoke with a frenchman yesterday who said that a venetian ship loaded with treasure was wrecked in the english channel .
you should tell antonio what you hear — but don ’ t do it suddenly , because it might upset him .
i saw bassanio and antonio say goodbye .
bassanio told him he ’ d try to hurry back .
as for the jew ’ s contract , don ’ t let it be a factor in your plans .
then he shook bassanio ’ s hand affectionately — and they separated .
i think he only loves life because of bassanio .
let ’ s go find him and cheer him up .
yes , let ’ s do that .
hurry , hurry , close the curtain quick .
the prince of arragon has taken his oath , and he ’ s coming to make his choice now .
look , here are the boxes , prince .
if you choose the one that contains my picture , we ’ ll be married right away .
but if you fail , you have to leave immediately .
everyone who comes to gamble on winning me has to swear to these three rules .
okay , i ’ m ready .
i hope luck will give me what my heart hopes for !
gold , silver , and common lead .
he who chooses me must give and risk all he has . ” you ’ d have to be more attractive for me to give or risk anything for you .
what does the golden box say ?
hmm , let me see :
we seemed to have two separate bodies , but we had one heart .
do you want to destroy our old friendship by joining these men to insult your poor friend ?
it ’ s not friendly , and it ’ s not ladylike .
all women would be angry with you for doing it , even though i ’ m the only one who ’ s hurt by it .
i ’ m not insulting you .
it sounds more like you ’ re insulting me .
didn ’ t you send lysander , as an insult , to follow me around praising my eyes and my face ?
haven ’ t you made your other love , demetrius — who kicked me with his foot not long ago — call me a goddess and a divine , rare , precious , heavenly creature ?
why does he talk like that to a girl he can ’ t stand ?
and why does lysander deny that he loves you , when he loves you so deeply ?
why does it matter that i ’ m not as lucky or lovable as you are and that the love i feel is unrequited ?
you should pity me for that reason , not hate me .
i don ’ t know what you ’ re talking about .
oh , fine .
all right , go ahead , keep up your little game , pretend to be sympathetic , but then nudge each other and wink and make faces at me when i turn my back .
if you had any sense of pity , or manners , you wouldn ’ t pretend to fight over me like this .
but goodbye .
it ’ s partly my own fault , since i followed you here .
stay , lovely helena .
listen to my excuse .
my love , my life , my soul , beautiful helena !
that ’ s a good one .
you can ’ t force me any more than hermia can beg me .
your threats are no stronger than her whining . — helena , i love you .
i swear i do .
i ’ ll give my life for you , just to prove this guy wrong when he says i don ’ t love you .
i say that i love you more than he does .
if that ’ s what you say , go fight a duel with me and prove it .
lysander , where are you going with all this ?
why have you gotten so rude ?
your darling ?
get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
get out , you horrible poison .
get out !
are you joking ?
of course he is , and so are you .
demetrius , i ’ m ready to fight you as promised .
i wish we had a signed legal contract .
i don ’ t trust you .
sure , i hate her , but i wouldn ’ t hurt her .
i certainly did , and i never wanted to see you again .
so stop hoping and wondering what i mean .
i ’ ve spelled it out for you clearly .
oh , no !
oh , that ’ s very nice !
you ought to be ashamed of yourself !
puppet ” ?
why “ puppet ” ? — oh , i see where this is going .
so how short am i , you painted barber pole ?
tell me .
how short am i ?
good hermia , please don ’ t act so bitter toward me .
he followed you .
and i followed him because i loved him .
but he told me to get lost and threatened to hit me , kick me — even kill me .
please let me go .
you see how naïve and foolish i ’ ve been .
well , get out of here then !
what ’ s keeping you ?
my stupid heart , which i ’ m leaving behind here .
what , you ’ re leaving it with lysander ?
no , with demetrius .
don ’ t be afraid .
she can ’ t hurt you , helena .
she was a hellcat in school .
and she ’ s fierce , even though she ’ s little .
little ” again ?
nothing but “ little ” and “ short ” ! — why are you letting her insult me like this ?
let me at her ! .
how are you , my love ? — demetrius and egeus , come with us .
i want you to do some things for our wedding , and i also want to discuss something that concerns you both .
we ’ re following you not only because it is our duty , but also because we want to .
what ’ s going on , my love ?
why are you so pale ?
why have your rosy cheeks faded so quickly ?
probably because my cheeks ' roses needed rain , which i could easily give them with all the tears in my eyes .
oh , honey !
listen , in books they say that true love always faces obstacles .
either the lovers have different social standings —
leave hermia alone .
don ’ t talk about helena .
don ’ t take helena ’ s side .
if you continue treating hermia so badly , you ’ ll pay for it .
hermia ’ s not holding onto me anymore .
follow me if you ’ re brave enough , and we ’ ll fight over helena .
follow ” ?
no , i ’ ll walk right next to you , side by side .
all this fighting is because of you .
stay where you are .
i don ’ t know what to say .
believe me , king of illusions , i made a mistake .
didn ’ t you tell me that i ’ d be able to recognize the man by the athenian clothes he was wearing ?
so far i ’ ve done exactly what i was supposed to do — i put the love potion on an athenian ’ s eyes .
and so far i ’ m pleased with the way things have turned out , since i find all of this commotion very entertaining .
as you can see , these lovers are looking for a place to fight .
hurry up , robin , and make the night dark and cloudy .
cover the sky with a low-hanging fog , as dark as hell , and get these overeager rivals so completely lost in the woods that they can ’ t run into each other .
we ’ ve got to act fast , my lord of the fairies .
i like the morning .
i often wander around in the woods like a forest ranger until the sun rises in the fiery red sky over the ocean , turning the salty green water to gold .
but you should hurry anyway .
don ’ t delay .
we still have time to get all of this done before daybreak .
up and down , up and down , i will lead them up and down .
the people fear me in the country and the town .
goblin , lead them up and down .
here comes one of them now .
where are you , demetrius , you arrogant bastard ?
say something .
lysander , say something !
you coward , did you run away from me ?
say something !
are you behind some bush ?
where are you hiding ?
are you there ?
he ’ s walking ahead of me , and he keeps daring me to follow him .
when i reach the place he ’ s calling from , he disappears .
this villain is much quicker than i am .
i ’ ll rest here .
where are you now ?
no , you ’ re just taunting me .
you ’ ll pay for this if i ever see you face-to-face in the daylight .
go wherever you want .
oh , what a long , tedious , exhausting night !
only three so far ?
we ’ re still waiting for one more .
two of both kinds makes four .
ah , here she comes , angry and sad .
cupid is a bad boy for making poor women go crazy like this .
i ’ ll sleep here until morning .
if they do fight , i hope lysander is safe !
sleep well there on the ground .
where ’ s peaseblossom ?
here .
scratch my head , peaseblossom .
where ’ s monsieur cobweb ?
here .
don ’ t tire yourself out , monsieur .
oh , and monsieur , be careful not to break the honey-sac .
i ’ d hate to see you drowned in honey , sir .
where ’ s monsieur mustardseed ?
here .
give me your first , mr. mustardseed .
please , stop bowing , good sir .
what would you like me to do ?
nothing , good sir , except to help sir cobweb scratch my head .
i should go to the barber ’ s , monsieur , because i think i ’ m getting really hairy around the face .
and i ’ m such a sensitive ass that if my hair even tickles me a little , i need to scratch .
would you like to hear some music , my sweet love ?
i have a pretty good ear for music .
let ’ s hear someone play the triangle and the sticks .
or tell me , my sweet love , what you ’ d like to eat .
actually , i ’ d like a few pounds of grass .
i ’ d like to munch on some good dry oats .
or maybe i ’ ve got a hankering for a bundle of hay .
there ’ s nothing like good hay , really sweet hay .
i have an adventurous fairy who ’ ll go seek out the squirrel ’ s secret stash and get you some fresh nuts .
i ’ d rather have a handful or two of dried peas .
but please don ’ t let any of your people wake me up .
i really want to sleep now .
go to sleep , and i will wrap my arms around you .
oh , how i love you !
i ’ m so crazy about you !
welcome , good robin .
do you see this sweet sight ?
now i ’ m starting to pity titania for being so infatuated .
i ran into her recently at the edge of the forest , looking for sweet presents for this hateful idiot , and i scolded her and argued with her .
and now that i have the boy , i ’ ll undo the spell that makes her vision so disgustingly wrong .
but first i ’ ll release the fairy queen from the spell .
now , titania , wake up , my sweet queen .
there ’ s your boyfriend , sleeping right over there .
how did this happen ?
oh , i hate looking at his face now !
be quiet for a while . — robin , take off his donkey head . — titania , get the fairies to play some music , and make these five people sleep more soundly than humans have ever slept before .
music !
play the kind of music that puts people to sleep .
play the music . — take my hands , my queen , and we ’ ll lull these people to sleep with our soft dancing .
being too old to marry someone young .
or else their guardians and advisors said no — what hell , to have your love life determined by someone else !
that ’ s how intense things like love are quickly destroyed .
if true lovers are always thwarted , then it must be a rule of fate .
that ’ s the right attitude .
so , listen , hermia .
i have an aunt who is a widow , who ’ s very rich and doesn ’ t have any children .
she lives about twenty miles from athens , and she thinks of me as a son .
i could marry you there , gentle hermia , where the strict laws of athens can ’ t touch us .
so here ’ s the plan .
listen , fairy king .
i can hear the lark singing .
morning ’ s here .
while we ’ re walking , you can tell me how i ended up sleeping on the ground with these humans last night .
one of you go find the forest ranger .
unleash the dogs in the western valley .
let them go .
now go find the forest ranger .
my beautiful queen , we ’ ll go up the mountain and listen to the hounds as their barking echoes in the cliffs and sounds like music .
i was with the heroes hercules and cadmus once , when their spartan hunting dogs cornered a bear .
the forests , the skies , the mountains , everything around us seemed to echo the barks of the hounds .
i ’ d never heard such raucous music , such pleasant thunder .
i don ’ t understand why they ’ re all here together .
but tell me , egeus .
isn ’ t today the day when hermia has to tell us her decision about whether she ’ ll marry demetrius ?
it is , my lord .
go tell the hunters to blow their horns and wake them up .
good morning , my friends .
valentine ’ s day is over .
are you lovebirds only starting to pair up now ?
forgive us , my lord .
please , all of you , stand up .
my lord , what i say may be a little confused , since i ’ m half asleep and half awake .
i swear , at the moment i really couldn ’ t tell you how i ended up here .
but i think — i want to tell you the truth , and now that i think about it , i think this is true — i came here with hermia .
now the only person i love , and believe in , and want to look at , is helena .
i was engaged to her before i ever met hermia .
you pretty lovers are lucky you met me here .
we ’ ll talk more about this later . — egeus , i ’ m overriding your wishes .
come with us to athens .
we three couples will celebrate with a sumptuous feast .
are you sure we ’ re awake ?
it seems to me like we ’ re still sleeping , still dreaming .
and he told us to follow him to the temple .
well , then , we ’ re awake .
i ’ ll call it “ bottom ’ s dream ” because it ’ s so deep that it has no bottom .
and i ’ ll sing it for the duke in the intermission of a play .
or maybe , to make it even more lovely , i ’ ll sing it when the heroine dies .
have you sent anyone to bottom ’ s house ?
has he come home yet ?
no one ’ s heard from him .
i ’ m sure he ’ s been kidnapped .
if he doesn ’ t show up , the play is ruined .
it won ’ t go on .
will it ?
no , it would be impossible .
he ’ s quite simply the smartest working-man in athens .
yes , and the best looking too .
and his voice is the paramour of sweetness .
you mean “ paragon . ” a the duke ’ s leaving the temple .
two or three more lords and ladies have been married too .
if we ’ d been able to put on our play , we would have had it made .
oh that great , funny guy , bottom !
he would have gotten a pension of six pence a day for his whole life .
six pence a day would ’ ve been forced on him .
i ’ ll be damned if the duke wouldn ’ t have given him six pence a day for playing pyramus .
and he would have deserved it too .
where are my good fellows ?
bottom !
oh , how wonderful to see you !
oh , what a relief !
i ’ ll tell you everything exactly as it happened .
tell us , bottom .
no , you won ’ t get a word out of me .
all i ’ ll tell you is that the duke has had dinner already .
now it ’ s time to get your costumes together .
meet me at the palace as soon as possible .
look over your lines again .
and no one eat any onions or garlic .
if we have sweet-smelling breath , i ’ m sure they ’ ll say “ it ’ s a sweet play . ” now no more talking .
get busy , go !
these lovers are saying some strange things , theseus .
i ’ ll never believe any of these old legends or fairy tales .
lunatics , lovers , and poets all are ruled by their overactive imaginations .
their story is bizarre and astounding , but it ’ s solid and consistent .
here come the lovers , laughing happily . — i wish you joy , my friends !
now , what kind of entertainment do we have to fill up the long three hours between dinner and bedtime ?
where is our entertainment director ?
what performances have been prepared ?
let me see philostrate .
here i am , theseus .
which plays , what music ?
how will we pass the time without some entertainment ?
keep your promise , my love .
look , here comes helena .
hello , beautiful helena !
where are you going ?
did you just call me “ beautiful ” ?
take it back .
you ’ re the beautiful one as far as demetrius is concerned .
oh , you ’ re so lucky !
your eyes are like stars , and your voice is more musical than a lark ’ s song is to a shepherd in the springtime .
if the world were mine , i ’ d give it all up — everything except demetrius — to be you .
the nine muses mourning the death of learning and scholarship . ” that ’ s some sharp , critical satire , and it ’ s not appropriate for a wedding .
short but still tedious ?
that ’ s like hot ice and strange snow .
how can this drama be so many contradictory things ?
it ’ s a play about ten words long , which is the shortest play i ’ ve ever heard of .
in the entire play , not one word is well-written , and not one of the actors is right for his part .
it ’ s tragic because pyramus kills himself .
i have to admit that when i saw his suicide during rehearsal , i had tears in my eyes — but they were tears of laughter .
who are the actors ?
so let ’ s see it .
no , my noble lord .
this play isn ’ t right for you .
i ’ ve seen the whole thing , and it ’ s completely worthless — unless you think their bad acting and their misremembered lines — which they memorized so painfully — are funny .
i ’ ll watch this play .
come on , bring them in .
you won ’ t see anything like that , sweetheart .
he just said that they ’ re no good at acting .
therefore , love and tongue-tied simplicity can say the most even when they ’ re saying the least , in my opinion .
your grace , the person who is going to deliver the prologue is ready .
let him come forward .
if we happen to offend you , it ’ s because we want to .
we don ’ t want you to think we came here to offend you , except that we want to offend you with our good intentions .
please keep in mind we ’ re only here out of spite .
we don ’ t come here with the intention of making you happy .
we ’ re absolutely not here to delight you .
by watching their show , you ’ ll find out everything you ’ re likely to know .
this guy doesn ’ t pay much attention to punctuation .
he rode that prologue like a wild horse .
he didn ’ t know how to stop it .
the moral of this story is that it ’ s not enough to speak ; you have to speak grammatically .
his speech was like a tangled chain .
who ’ s next ?
i wonder if the lion ’ s going to talk .
it wouldn ’ t surprise me , my lord .
can you imagine cement and stone talking better ?
it ’ s the smartest partition i ’ ve ever heard speak , my lord .
pyramus is coming up to the wall .
be quiet !
i ’ m afraid my thisbe has forgotten her promise ! — and you , oh wall , oh sweet , oh lovely wall , you stand between her father ’ s property and mine , you wall , oh wall , oh sweet and lovely wall .
god bless you for doing this .
but what ’ s this i see ?
i don ’ t see any thisbe .
oh wicked wall , through which i don ’ t see any happiness !
damn your stones for disappointing me like this !
since the wall is conscious , it should curse back at him .
i see a voice !
i ’ ll go to the hole to see if i can hear my thisbe ’ s face .
thisbe ?
you are my love , my love , i think .
i ’ m your love , no matter what you think .
will you meet me right away at ninny ’ s grave ?
neither death nor life will stop me from coming .
i , wall , have done my part .
now that i ’ m done , wall can go away .
this is the silliest thing i ’ ve ever seen .
the best plays are still only illusions , and the worst are just as good , if you just use your imagination to fill them in .
in that case it ’ s your imagination that ’ s interesting , not the play .
look , here come two noble animals , a man and a lion .
ah , it ’ s a sensitive animal , with a good conscience .
he ’ s as brave as a fox .
true .
and as wise as a goose .
oh , that ’ s not true , my lord .
he ’ s not brave enough to be wise .
he ’ s not wise enough to be brave .
anyway , he is what he is .
let ’ s listen to the moon .
this lantern represents the moon .
i myself am playing the man in the moon — well then , that ’ s the biggest mistake of all .
the man should be inside the lantern .
how else is he the “ man in the moon ” ?
he can ’ t go in there because of the candle .
it ’ s too hot .
i ’ m tired of this moon .
go ahead , moon .
all i wanted to tell you is that the lantern is the moon , i ’ m the man in the moon , this thornbush is my thornbush , and this dog is my dog .
well , all of these should be in the lantern , because they ’ re all in the moon .
but be quiet , here comes thisbe .
this is old ninny ’ s tomb .
but where is my love ?
good roaring , lion !
good running , thisbe !
good shining , moon ! — really , the moon shines very well .
that ’ s good , lion !
oh , teach me how you look the way you do , and which tricks you used to make demetrius fall in love with you .
i frown at him , but he still loves me .
oh , if only my smiles could inspire love as effectively as your frowns !
i curse him , but he loves me .
if only my prayers could inspire that kind of affection !
the more i hate him , the more he follows me around .
the more i love him , the more he hates me .
it ’ s not my fault he acts like that , helena .
that ’ s true , it ’ s your beauty ’ s fault .
i wish i had a fault like that !
don ’ t worry .
he won ’ t see my face ever again .
lysander and i are running away from here .
before i saw lysander , athens seemed like paradise to me .
but lysander ’ s so attractive that he ’ s turned heaven into hell !
helena , we ’ ll tell you about our secret plan .
tomorrow night , when the moon shines on the water and decorates the grass with tiny beads of pearly light ( the time of night that always hides runaway lovers ) , we plan to sneak out of athens .
and then pyramus showed up .
so the lion disappeared .
sweet moon , i thank you for your sunny beams .
but , look , poor me , what a terrible tragedy is here !
eyes , do you see ?
how can it be ?
oh , dainty duck !
oh , dear !
oh , fate , come and cut the thread of my life .
conquer , crush , conclude , and kill !
oh , mother nature , why did you create lions ?
and so i ’ m dying .
okay , now i ’ m dead .
now die , die , die , die , die .
with a doctor ’ s help he might recover and become an ass again .
i don ’ t think a ridiculous pyramus like that one deserves much moaning .
i hope she keeps it short .
look , she ’ s spotted him with those sweet eyes of hers .
and now she ’ ll start moaning , of course — are you asleep , my love ?
what , are you dead , my dove ?
oh , pyramus , get up !
speak , speak .
can ’ t you talk ?
dead , dead ?
the dirt of a grave must cover your sweet eyes !
your lily-white lips , your cherry-red nose , and your buttercup-yellow cheeks are gone , gone forever .
lovers , moan and weep .
his eyes were as green as leeks .
oh , fate , come , come to me , with hands as pale as milk .
soak your hands in blood and gore , since you have cut the thread of his life with scissors .
tongue , do not speak .
come , trusty sword .
come , blade , drench my breast with blood .
moonshine and lion are left to bury the dead .
yes , and wall too .
no epilogue , please .
never apologize — when the actors are all dead , no one can be blamed .
as a matter of fact , if the playwright had played pyramus and hanged himself with thisbe ’ s belt , it would have been a very good tragedy .
it ’ s a good tragedy , very well done .
but come on , let ’ s see you do your dance .
forget your epilogue .
the clock has chimed midnight .
lovers , it ’ s time to go to bed .
it ’ s almost fairy time .
dear friends , let ’ s go to bed .
let the dying fire shine a glimmering light throughout the house .
first rehearse your song from memory , and make sure each note is pretty .
we ’ ll all join hands and sing , and bless this place with our fairy grace .
if you forgive us , we ’ ll make everything all right .
i ’ m an honest puck , and i swear that if we ’ re lucky enough not to get hissed at , we ’ ll make it up to you soon .
if not , then i ’ m a liar .
so good night to everyone .
give me some applause , if we ’ re friends , and robin will make everything up to you .
from then on we ’ ll turn our backs on athens .
we ’ ll look for new friends and keep the company of strangers .
goodbye , old friend .
we need to stay away from each other until midnight tomorrow .
i will , my hermia .
goodbye , helena .
i hope demetrius comes to love you as much as you love him !
but so what ?
demetrius doesn ’ t think so , and that ’ s all that matters .
he refuses to admit what everyone else knows .
love can make worthless things beautiful .
when we ’ re in love , we don ’ t see with our eyes but with our minds .
that ’ s why paintings of cupid , the god of love , always show him as blind .
and love doesn ’ t have good judgment either — cupid , has wings and no eyes , so he ’ s bound to be reckless and hasty .
that ’ s why they say love is a child .
he ’ ll run after her .
is everyone here ?
first , peter quince , tell us what the play is about , then read the names of the actors , and then shut up .
answer when i call your name . — nick bottom , the weaver ?
here .
tell me which part i ’ m going to play , then go on .
you , nick bottom , have been cast as pyramus .
what ’ s pyramus ?
i ’ ll moan very believably . — name the other actors . — but i ’ m really in the mood to play a tyrant .
i could do a great job with hercules , or any other part that requires ranting and raving .
a lover would have to be weepier , of course .
francis flute , the bellows-repairman ?
here , peter quince .
who ’ s thisbe ?
a knight on a quest ?
thisbe is the lady pyramus is in love with .
no , come on , don ’ t make me play a woman .
i ’ m growing a beard .
that doesn ’ t matter .
you ’ ll wear a mask , and you can make your voice as high as you want to .
in that case , if i can wear a mask , let me play thisbe too !
bottom , you ’ re pyramus . — and flute , you ’ re thisbe .
robin starveling , the tailor ?
here , peter quince .
robin starveling , you ’ re going to play thisbe ’ s mother . — tom snout , the handyman .
here , peter quince .
i hope this play is well cast now .
do you have the lion ’ s part written down ?
if you do , please give it to me , because i need to start learning the lines .
let me play the lion too .
and that would get us all executed .
yeah , that would get every single one of us executed .
well , my friends , you ’ ve got to admit that if you scare the living daylights out of the ladies , they ’ d have no choice but to execute us .
because pyramus is a good-looking man , the most handsome man that you could find on a summer ’ s day , a lovely gentlemanly man .
so you ’ re the only one who could play pyramus .
well then , i ’ ll do it .
what kind of beard should i wear for the part ?
whatever kind you want , i guess .
no , you ’ ll see , four days will quickly turn into four nights .
and since we dream at night , time passes quickly then .
finally the new moon , curved like a silver bow in the sky , will look down on our wedding celebration .
sadness is only appropriate for funerals .
we don ’ t want it at our festivities .
but i ’ ll marry you under different circumstances — with extravagant festivals , public festivities , and celebration .
long live theseus , our famous and respected duke !
i ’ ll play the part wearing either a straw-colored beard , or a sandy beard , or a red beard , or one of those bright yellow beards that ’ s the color of a french coin .
it ’ s best to rehearse there , because if we do it here in the city , we ’ ll be bothered by crowds of people and everyone will know the plot of our play .
meanwhile , i ’ ll make a list of props that we ’ ll need for the play .
don ’ t leave me in the lurch .
we ’ ll be there , and there we ’ ll rehearse courageously and wonderfully , truly obscenely .
goodbye .
we ’ ll meet at the giant oak tree in the duke ’ s forest .
got it ?
be there , or don ’ t show your face again .
hello , spirit !
where are you going ?
i go over hills and valleys , through bushes and thorns , over parks and fenced-in spaces , through water and fire .
i wander everywhere faster than the moon revolves around the earth .
i work for titania , the fairy queen , and organize fairy dances for her in the grass .
the cowslip flowers are her bodyguards .
their sweet smells come from those little freckles .
now i have to go find some dewdrops and hang a pearl earring on every cowslip flower .
goodbye , you dumb old spirit .
i ’ ve got to go .
the queen and her elves will be here soon .
he ’ s furious because she stole an adorable boy from an indian king .
he wants the child for himself , to accompany him on his wanderings through the wild forests .
instead , she puts flowers in the boy ’ s hair and makes a fuss over him .
you do their work for them and give them good luck .
that ’ s you , right ?
what you say is true .
that ’ s me you ’ re talking about , the playful wanderer of the night .
when she takes a sip , i bob up against her lips and make her spill the drink all over her withered old neck .
but step aside , fairy !
here comes oberon .
and here ’ s my mistress , titania .
i wish he ’ d go away !
how what , are you jealous , oberon ? — fairies , let ’ s get out of here .
i ’ ve sworn i ’ ll never sleep with him or talk to him again .
wait just a minute , you brazen hussy .
the only reason you left india was to come here and see that butch amazon hippolyta .
she was your boot-wearing mistress and your warrior lover , and now that she ’ s getting married to theseus , you ’ ve come to celebrate their marriage .
how can you stand there shamelessly talking about me and hippolyta , when you know that i know about your love for theseus ?
weren ’ t you the one who made him desert perigouna in the middle of the night , right after he ’ d raped her ?
and weren ’ t you the one who made him cheat on all of his other girlfriends , like aegles , ariadne , and antiopa ?
these are nothing but jealous lies .
and because you interrupt us so that we can ’ t dance for them , the winds have made fogs rise up out of the sea and fall down on the rivers so that the rivers flood , just to get revenge on you .
so all the work that oxen and farmers have done in plowing the fields has been for nothing , because the unripe grain has rotted before it was ripe .
sheep pens are empty in the middle of the flooded fields , and the crows get fat from eating the dead bodies of infected sheep .
so the pale , angry moon , who controls the tides , fills the air with diseases .
spring , summer , fertile autumn and angry winter have all changed places , and now the confused world doesn ’ t know which is which .
and this is all because of our argument .
we are responsible for this .
do something about it , then .
you have the power to fix it .
why would titania want to argue with her oberon ?
all i ’ m asking for is to have that little human boy as part of my crew .
get over it .
i won ’ t give up this child for all of fairyland .
how long do you plan to stay here in this forest ?
maybe until after theseus ’ s wedding day .
if you behave yourself and join us in our circle dance and moonlight celebrations , then you can come with us .
if not , leave me alone , and i ’ ll stay away from your turf .
give me that boy and i ’ ll come with you .
not for your entire fairy kingdom . — come , fairies , let ’ s go .
we ’ re going to have an out-and-out brawl if i stay any longer .
well , go on your way , then .
you won ’ t leave this grove until i ’ ve paid you back for this insult .
yes , i remember .
you couldn ’ t see him , but i could .
he took aim at a beautiful young virgin who was sitting on a throne in the western part of the world , and he shot his arrow of love well enough to have pierced a hundred thousand hearts .
but i could see that cupid ’ s fiery arrow was put out by watery , virginal moonbeams , so the royal virgin continued her virginal thoughts without being interrupted by thoughts of love .
but i paid attention to where cupid ’ s arrow fell .
it fell on a little western flower , which used to be white as milk but now has turned purple from being wounded by the arrow of love .
young girls call it “ love-in-idleness . ” bring me that flower .
i showed it to you once .
if its juice is put on someone ’ s eyelids while they ’ re asleep , that person will fall in love with the next living creature he or she sees .
bring me this plant , and get back here before the sea monster has time to swim three miles .
i could go around the world in forty minutes .
when i have the juice of that flower , i ’ ll trickle some drops of it on titania ’ s eyes while she ’ s sleeping .
she ’ ll fall madly in love with the first thing she sees when she wakes up — even if it ’ s a lion , a bear , a wolf , a bull , a monkey , or an ape .
and before i make her normal again — i can cure her by treating her with another plant — i ’ ll make her give me that little boy as my page .
but who ’ s that coming this way ?
look , i don ’ t love you , so stop following me around .
where are lysander and beautiful hermia ?
lysander i want to stop , but hermia stops my heart from beating .
you told me they escaped into this forest .
and here i am , going crazy in the middle of the woods because i can ’ t find my hermia .
go away , get out of here , and stop following me .
you attract me to you , you cruel magnet !
but you must not attract iron , because my heart is as true as steel .
if you let go of your power to attract me , i won ’ t have any power to follow you .
do i ask you to follow me ?
do i speak to you kindly ?
don ’ t i tell you in the clearest terms that i do not and cannot love you ?
yes , but that makes me love you even more .
i ’ m your little dog , demetrius .
the more you beat me , the more i ’ ll love you .
treat me like you would treat a dog — kick me , hit me , neglect me , try to lose me .
just let me follow behind you , even though i ’ m not good enough for you .
just looking at you makes me sick .
and i get sick when i can ’ t look at you .
i rely on your virtue to protect me .
this forest doesn ’ t seem deserted when you ’ re here , because you are all the world to me .
so how can anyone say i ’ m alone , when the whole world is here to look at me ?
i ’ ll run away from you and hide in the bushes , and leave you to the mercy of wild animals .
the wildest animal isn ’ t as cruel as you are .
leave me alone .
or if you follow me , you ’ d better understand that i ’ ll do something bad to you in the forest .
yes , you already hurt me in the church , in the town , and in the fields .
shame on you , demetrius !
your behavior is an insult to all women .
we cannot fight for love as men can .
i ’ ll follow you and turn this hell i ’ m in into a kind of heaven .
goodbye , nymph .
before he leaves this part of the forest , you ’ ll change places : you ’ ll be the one running away , and he ’ ll be in love with you .
do you have the flower ?
welcome , traveler .
yes , here it is .
please , give it to me .
thanks , good egeus .
what ’ s new with you ?
since she belongs to me , i can do what i want with her — as the law says : i can either make her marry demetrius — or have her killed .
what do you have to say for yourself , hermia ?
demetrius is an admirable man .
titania sleeps there sometimes at night , lulled to sleep among the flowers by dances and other delights .
snakes shed their skin there , and the shed skin is wide enough to wrap a fairy in .
i ’ ll put the juice of this flower on titania ’ s eyes , and fill her with horrible delusions and desires .
don ’ t worry , sir .
i ’ m at your service .
okay , let ’ s go !
everything ’ s fine now .
one of us will stay and stand guard .
whatever you see first when you wake up , think of it as your true love .
wake up when something nasty is nearby .
let ’ s do that , lysander .
i ’ m going to rest my head on this little slope .
we ’ ll have one heart , one bed , two bodies , and one faithful vow .
no , lysander .
don ’ t sleep so close to me .
i just meant that our hearts are joined , so we can almost think of them as one heart .
so let me sleep next to you .
stay away for now , and good night , my sweet friend .
i hope your love for me remains this strong for your entire life !
amen to that .
i ’ ll sleep over here .
stop , demetrius !
stop , even if only to kill me .
i ’ m telling you , get out of here , and don ’ t follow me around like this .
oh , will you leave me alone in the dark ?
don ’ t .
stay here at your own risk .
i ’ m going on alone .
oh , i ’ m out of breath from this foolish chase .
the more i pray , the less i get out of it .
hermia is lucky , wherever she is , because she has beautiful eyes .
how did her eyes get so bright ?
not from crying .
if that ’ s the case , tears wash my eyes more than hers .
no , no , i ’ m as ugly as a bear , since animals that see me run away in terror .
so it ’ s no surprise that demetrius runs away from me as if i were a monster .
what evil and deceitful mirror made me think i could rival hermia ’ s starry eyes ?
don ’ t say that , lysander .
don ’ t say that .
why do you care that he loves hermia ?
what does it matter ?
happy with hermia ?
no .
i regret all the boring time i wasted with her .
i don ’ t love hermia ; i love helena .
fruits and vegetables don ’ t ripen until the right season of the year .
likewise , i ’ m young , and my sense of reason has just ripened .
is it not enough , is it not enough , young man , that i ’ ll never be pretty enough to get a kind look from demetrius ?
do you have to harp on my inadequacy ?
but goodbye .
i have to tell you , i thought you were a much kinder person than this .
oh , how awful that a lady who ’ s been rejected by one man should therefore be treated horribly by another one !
are we all here ?
right on time .
this is the perfect place to rehearse .
this clearing will be the stage , and this hawthorn bush will be our dressing room .
peter quince — what is it , jolly bottom ?
there are things in this comedy of pyramus and thisbe that will never work .
first of all , pyramus has to take out a sword to kill himself , which the ladies in the audience won ’ t be able to stand .
what should we do about that ?
i think we ’ ll have to leave out all the killing , come to think of it .
not at all !
i ’ ve got a plan that will fix everything .
i ’ ll tell them that we won ’ t hurt anyone with our swords , and that pyramus isn ’ t really dead .
and to make it even clearer , we can tell them that i ’ m playing pyramus but i ’ m not really pyramus — really , i ’ m bottom the weaver .
that ’ ll keep them from being afraid .
all right , we ’ ll have a prologue then .
we ’ ll write it in alternating eight- and six-syllable lines , just like in a ballad .
no , add a couple more syllables .
make it eight and eight .
won ’ t the ladies be scared of the lion ?
i ’ m really worried about that .
there ’ s no scarier wild bird than the living lion , and we should remember that .
so we need another prologue to tell everyone he ’ s not a real lion .
no , we can just announce the actor ’ s name , and let his face show through the lion costume , and have him say something himself .
because , you know , pyramus and thisbe meet by moonlight .
so is lysander .
you ’ re right , lysander ’ s admirable too .
but since your father doesn ’ t want him to marry you , you have to consider demetrius to be the better man .
i wish my father could see them with my eyes .
no , you must see them as your father sees them .
your grace , please forgive me .
so think carefully about what you want , beautiful hermia .
consider how young you are , and question your feelings .
will the moon be shining on the night we ’ re performing our play ?
we need a calendar !
look in the almanac .
look up moonshine , look up moonshine !
what do you think , bottom ?
he can hold his fingers in a v-shape like this , and pyramus and thisbe can whisper to each other through that little crack .
if we can do that , everything will be all right .
now sit down , everybody , and rehearse your parts — pyramus , you start .
when you have said your lines , go hide in that bush . — everyone else , go there too when you ’ re not onstage .
speak , pyramus . — thisbe , come forward .
yes , you are .
you ’ re supposed to show that you understand that pyramus just went to check on a noise he heard and is coming right back .
that ’ s “ ninus ’ s grave , ” man .
and don ’ t say all of that yet .
you just said all your lines at once , cues and all . — pyramus , enter .
it ’ s “ never get tired . ” oh !
help !
it ’ s a monster !
we ’ re being haunted .
run , everyone , run !
i ’ ll follow you .
sometimes i ’ ll turn into fire !
and i ’ ll neigh like a horse and bark like a hound and grunt like a pig and roar like a bear and burn like a fire at every turn .
why are they running away ?
oh , bottom , you ’ ve changed !
what have you got on your head ?
what do you think i ’ ve got on my head ?
you ’ re acting like an ass , don ’ t you think ?
god bless you , bottom , god bless you .
reborn .
but i won ’ t leave this spot , no matter what they do .
i ’ ll walk up and down and sing a song , so they ’ ll know i ’ m not afraid .
who ’ d waste his time talking to such a stupid bird ?
i don ’ t think you ’ ve got much of a reason to love me .
but to tell you the truth , reason and love have very little to do with each other these days .
it ’ s too bad some mutual friend of theirs doesn ’ t introduce them .
you ’ re as wise as you are beautiful .
no , that ’ s not true .
but if i were smart enough to get out of this forest , i ’ d be wise enough to satisfy myself .
i ’ m no ordinary fairy .
so come with me .
and i ’ ll turn you into a spirit like us , so you won ’ t die as humans do . — come here , peaseblossom , cobweb , moth , and mustardseed !
ready .
me too .
me too .
and me too .
where should we go ?
be kind and polite to this gentleman .
leap and dance for him .
feed him apricots and blackberries , with purple grapes , green figs , and mulberries .
pluck off colorful butterfly wings , and use them to fan moonbeams away from his eyes as he sleeps .
bow to him , fairies , and curtsy to him .
hello , mortal !
hello !
hello !
hello !
i beg your pardon , sirs . — please tell me your name , sir ?
cobweb .
i ’ d like to get to know you better , mr. cobweb .
if i cut my finger , i ’ ll use you as a bandage to stop the bleeding . — and your name , sir ?
peaseblossom .
please , give my regards to your mother , mrs. peapod , and your father , mr. peapod .
good mr. peaseblossom , i ’ d like to get to know you better too . — and you , may i ask what your name is , sir ?
mustardseed .
good mr. mustardseed , i know you very well .
those cowardly , gigantic sides of beef have been responsible for many of your family members getting eaten as a condiment on beef .
i swear to you , many members of your mustard family have made my eyes water before .
i look forward to getting to know you better , mr. mustardseed .
take good care of him .
take him to my sleeping area .
the moon looks sad to me .
when she cries , all the little flowers cry too .
keep my lover quiet .
bring him to me in silence .
ah , here comes my messenger . — what ’ s going on , you crazy spirit ?
what havoc have you wreaked in this part of the forest ?
my mistress titania is in love with a monster .
i led them on in this frightened , distracted state , and left sweet
at that exact moment , titania woke up and immediately fell in love with him , an ass .
this is going even better than i planned .
but have you put the love juice from the flower on the eyes of that athenian , as i asked you to do ?
yes , i found him when he was asleep — so that ’ s taken care of too — and the athenian woman was sleeping near him .
why are you so rude to someone who loves you so much ?
save that kind of harsh language for your worst enemy .
if you killed lysander while he was sleeping , then you ’ re already up to your ankles in blood .
he was more faithful to me than the sun is to the daytime .
would he have snuck away from me while i was asleep ?
the only possibility is that you ’ ve murdered him .
a murderer should look like you do , so pale and grim .
that ’ s how someone who ’ s been murdered should look , and that ’ s how i look .
you ’ ve pierced me through the heart with your cruelty , and yet you , the murderer , look as bright and clear as a star in the sky .
what does that have to do with my lysander ?
where is he ?
oh , good demetrius , will you find him for me ?
did you kill him , then ?
oh , how brave of you !
a snake could do that as easily as you could .
a snake did do it , because no snake ever had a more forked , lying tongue than you have .
i didn ’ t kill lysander .
as far as i know , he ’ s not even dead .
then please tell me he ’ s all right .
if i told you that , what would i get out of it ?
please give in , sweet hermia . — and lysander , stop acting like she ’ s yours .
her father loves you , demetrius .
she ’ s mine , and i ’ m giving her to demetrius .
the privilege of never seeing me again .
and now i ’ m going to leave your despised company .
you ’ ll never see me again , whether or not he ’ s dead .
so i ’ ll stay here for a while .
that ’ s the way of the world .
go around the forest , moving faster than the wind , and make sure you find helena of athens . — she ’ s lovesick , and her face is pale from all the sighing she ’ s been doing , because sighing is bad for the blood .
you purple flower , hit by cupid ’ s arrow , sink into the pupils of this man ’ s eyes .
young man , when you wake up , if she ’ s nearby , beg her to cure your lovesickness .
should we watch this ridiculous scene ?
lord , what fools these mortals are !
step aside .
the noise they ’ re making will wake up demetrius .
then the two of them will both pursue one girl .
why do you think i ’ m making fun of you when i tell you i love you ?
people don ’ t cry when they ’ re mocking someone .
how can it seem like i ’ m making fun of you , when my tears prove that i ’ m sincere ?
you get trickier and trickier .
will you abandon her ?
demetrius loves her , and he doesn ’ t love you .
damn it !
i see you ’ re all determined to gang up on me for a few laughs .
you ’ re competing for
don ’ t be cruel , demetrius .
in exchange , give up your claim to love helena , since i love her and will love her until i die .
lysander , keep your hermia .
i don ’ t want her .
helena , it ’ s not true .
look , here comes the woman you love .
it ’ s hard to see clearly in the dark of night , but it ’ s easier to hear well .
i couldn ’ t see you , lysander , but i heard your voice , and that ’ s how i found you .
why did you leave me alone so unkindly ?
why stay when love tells you to go ?
but what love could make my lysander leave me ?
i had to hurry to my love , beautiful helena , who lights up the night better than all those fiery stars .
why are you looking for me ?
didn ’ t you figure out that i left you because i hate you ?
you can ’ t mean what you ’ re saying .
it ’ s impossible .
so , she ’ s in on this too !
now i see that all three of them have gotten together to play this cruel trick on me .
have you forgotten all the talks we ’ ve had together , the vows we made to be like sisters to one another , all the hours we spent together , wishing that we never had to say goodbye — have you forgotten ?
our friendship in our schooldays , our childhood innocence ?
we grew together like twin cherries — which seemed to be separate but were also together — two lovely cherries on one stem .
there is scorn and disdain in her eyes , and those sparkling eyes despise everything they look upon .
she can ’ t even imagine what “ love ” is .
it would be bad if she knew about benedick ’ s love and teased him about it .
it ’ s true .
and so she turns men inside out and never acknowledges the integrity and merit that a man has .
but who would dare tell her ?
if i said something , she ’ d mock me so mercilessly that i ’ d probably disintegrate into air .
she ’ d laugh me right out of my body and kill me with her wit .
like a fire that gets covered up , benedick should smother his love and waste away .
it would be better to die that way than to die from being mocked , which is as bad as being killed by tickling .
no , instead i ’ ll go to benedick and advise him to fight his emotions .
you don ’ t know how quickly affection can be killed with a single nasty word .
oh , don ’ t injure your cousin like that !
with the quick , intelligent wit she ’ s rumored to have , she can ’ t really be such a bad judge of character that she ’ d refuse a man as exceptional as signior benedick .
he ’ s the only worthy man in italy , aside from my dear claudio .
true , he has an excellent reputation .
and he deserves it , having been excellent before he had a reputation for it .
when are you getting married , madam ?
tomorrow , and then every day after that .
come on , let ’ s go inside .
i ’ ll stay in messina until you ’ re married , and then i ’ ll go to aragon .
i ’ ll go with you , my lord , if you ’ ll allow me .
no , taking you away from your new marriage would be like showing a child a new coat and then not letting him wear it .
i ’ ll ask only benedick to come with me , for from the top of his head to the soles of his feet he ’ s a joker .
he ’ s evaded love once or twice , and since then cupid doesn ’ t dare to shoot at him .
benedick ’ s heart is like a bell , with his tongue as the clapper : everything his heart thinks , his tongue speaks .
gentleman , i am not the same man i was before .
i agree .
i hope he ’ s in love .
there isn ’ t a single drop of sincerity in him that could be touched with love .
if he looks serious , he must need money .
what , are you moaning on about your toothache ?
i repeat , he ’ s in love .
unless you ’ re talking about his love for this kind of foolishness — which , judging from his appearance , he has — he is no fool for love , as you pretend .
if he ’ s not in love with a woman , then you can ’ t trust the usual symptoms .
he brushes his hat in the mornings .
what do you think that means ?
has any man seen him at the barber ’ s ?
no , but the barber ’ s assistant has been seen with him .
and he ’ s rubbed himself with perfume .
can you smell out his secret now ?
but when you take up your duties too cheerfully .
that ’ s what her mother always tells me .
ah , he got you back , benedick !
congratulations , lady : you resemble a most honorable man .
well , even if he is her father , i ’ m sure she wouldn ’ t want to have the head of the old man on her shoulders !
i ’ m amazed you ’ re still talking , signior benedick .
no one ’ s listening to you .
look , it ’ s my dear lady disdain !
aren ’ t you dead yet ?
that ’ s as good as proof that the sweet young man ’ s in love .
the biggest clue is his seriousness .
and when has he ever been known to wash his face ?
yes , or to wear cosmetics ?
i hear what they say about him for doing that .
indeed , his mocking spirit has now crawled into a truly , it all adds up to a serious story for benedick .
a conclusion , a conclusion : he is in love .
oh , and i know who loves him .
she ’ ll be buried with her face upwards , then .
this chatter is no cure for my toothache .
it must be .
my lord and brother , god save you .
good evening , brother .
if you don ’ t mind , i ’ d like to speak with you .
in private ?
if you wish .
but count claudio can stay , for what i ’ m about to say concerns him .
what ’ s the matter ?
you know that he does .
i don ’ t know that , once he knows what i know .
if there ’ s any reason we shouldn ’ t get married , i urge you to tell me .
you may think that i don ’ t love you .
i hope that , after i tell you my news , you will think better of me .
my brother thinks highly of you , and because of his affection , has helped arrange your marriage — but that was definitely a waste of his time and energy .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
i came here to tell you — i ’ ll make this short , since she ’ s already been talked about for too long — the lady is unfaithful .
who , hero ?
that ’ s the one : leonato ’ s hero , your hero , every man ’ s hero .
unfaithful ?
the word is too good to represent her wickedness .
she is worse than wicked .
if you can think of a more awful title , i ’ ll call her that .
but don ’ t keep wondering without more proof .
come with me tonight , and you ’ ll see a man enter her bedroom chamber — even tonight , the night before her wedding .
if you still love her after that , then marry her tomorrow .
but you would be more honorable if you changed your mind .
i won ’ t consider it .
if i see anything tonight that convinces me not to marry her , i ’ ll shame her tomorrow in the very congregation where i would have married her .
and since i wooed her in your name , i ’ ll join you in disgracing her .
remain calm until midnight , and then you ’ ll see what the trouble is .
oh , this day has turned into a disaster !
oh , mischief has ruined our plans !
oh , a plague has been prevented , thank god !
that ’ s what you ’ ll say once you ’ ve seen part two .
are you all good and honest men ?
come here , sir seacole .
god has blessed you with a good name .
to be good-looking is a matter of luck , but to read and write is a natural gift .
both of which , master constable — you have .
i knew that would be your answer .
well , for your good looks , sir , thank god and don ’ t boast about it .
you ’ re thought to be the most
you will and what if he won ’ t stop ?
then immediately call the rest of the watch together and thank god that you ’ ve gotten rid of such a criminal .
if he won ’ t stop when he ’ s told to , then he isn ’ t one of the prince ’ s subjects .
we know what ’ s appropriate for a watch .
why , you speak like an experienced and quiet watchman .
also , you ’ re supposed to visit all the bars and tell anyone who ’ s drunk to go home and go to bed .
and what if they won ’ t go ?
well then , leave them alone until they ’ re sober .
if even then they don ’ t answer to your satisfaction , you can say that they ’ re not the men you thought they were .
very good , sir .
so if we know that a man is a thief , should we try to arrest him ?
you , constable , are representing the prince himself .
if you meet the prince in the night , you can order him to stop .
no , by our lady , i don ’ t think he can .
by our lady , i think that ’ s true .
and if anything important happens , find me and let me know .
well gentlemen , we ’ ve heard our assignment .
let ’ s sit here on the church bench until two and then go off to bed .
one more thing , good gentlemen .
watch over signior leonato ’ s house ; with the wedding being held there tomorrow , there ’ s a great to-do there tonight .
adieu .
be conrade !
conrade , i say !
come to think of it , i thought i felt a scab there .
i ’ ll get you for that .
now get on with your story .
since it ’ s drizzling , stand under this overhang with me and , like a true drunk , i ’ ll tell you everything .
you should know i ’ ve earned a thousand gold pieces from don john .
is it possible that any crime could be so valuable ?
you should ask instead if it ’ s possible that any criminal could be so rich .
because when rich villains need poor villains ' services , those poor ones can name the price .
i can ’ t believe it .
that only proves how inexperienced you are .
you know that the style of a man ’ s jacket or hat or coat means nothing .
yes , it ’ s just clothing .
yes , fashion is fashion .
c ’ mon , i might as well say the fool ’ s the fool !
but don ’ t you see what a did you hear someone ?
just the weathervane moving .
but you ’ re all wound up about fashion , too .
no , i ’ m not wound up .
but i will tell you that i seduced margaret , the lady hero ’ s waiting woman , tonight .
i should backtrack and begin with how my master , don john , arranged for the prince , claudio , and himself to witness this friendly encounter from the orchard .
that makes lady courtesy a traitor .
all ladies love me , except you .
it ’ s too bad i ’ m so hard-hearted , because i really don ’ t love anyone .
women are lucky , then .
you would make a nasty suitor .
i would rather listen to my dog bark at a crow than hear a man swear that he loves me .
well , i hope you stay in that frame of mind or some poor man will end up with his face all scratched up .
if he has a face like yours , a good scratching couldn ’ t make him look any worse .
listen to you , instructing me like a parrot would .
i ’ d rather be a squawking bird than an animal like you .
i wish my horse moved as fast as your mouth and was as tireless .
that ’ s it — i ’ m done .
you always slip out of the argument like this .
i know you from before .
and that ’ s everything , leonato . — claudio , benedick — my dear friend leonato has invited you all to stay here at messina .
i told him we ’ ll stay for at least a month , and he says that he hopes we ’ ll stay longer .
i think he ’ s actually serious , and not just being polite .
and they thought margaret was hero ?
we charge you , in the prince ’ s name , to stop !
call up the master constable dogberry .
we have and one of them is the criminal deformed .
i know him ; he wears a lock of hair .
gentlemen , gentlemen — gentlemen , don ’ t speak .
we
we ’ re probably a very valuable catch for these guys .
let ’ s go , we ’ ll obey you .
good ursula , go wake my cousin and ask her to get up .
i will , lady .
and request that she come here .
very well .
really , i think your other ruff is better .
no , please good meg , i ’ ll wear this one .
honestly , it ’ s not as good as the other one , and i ’ m sure your cousin will agree with me .
my cousin ’ s a fool , and you are too .
i ’ ll wear this one and none other .
i like your new wig and headdress , though i ’ d like it more if the hair were a shade browner .
you know , i saw the duchess of milan ’ s gown , the one that everyone praises so highly .
oh , they say that dress surpasses all others .
but for a fine , elegant , graceful , and excellent dress , yours is worth ten of those .
i hope i enjoy wearing it , for my heart is very heavy .
it will be made even heavier soon — by the weight of a man .
shame of what , lady ?
sex and marriage are honorable things — even for a beggar , right ?
and isn ’ t your husband an honorable man ?
good morning , sweet hero .
why do you sound so odd ?
are you ill ?
you sound out of tune .
you sing , and i ’ ll dance .
never !
the count sent me an excellent pair of perfumed gloves .
sorry , i ’ m all stuffed .
ever since you lost yours .
doesn ’ t my wit suit me well ?
it doesn ’ t get seen enough ; you should wear it in your cap , the way fools wear coxcombs .
god , i ’ m really sick .
i just meant that you should use some holy thistle .
maybe you think that i think you ’ re in love .
but benedick was once an enemy of love as well , and now he ’ s become a real man .
he swore that he ’ d never get married , but now , despite his earlier protestations , he loves ungrudgingly .
and yet i think you look with your eyes just like every other woman does .
it ’ s not a false gallop , anyway .
madam , we have to go : the prince , the count , signior benedick , don john , and all the gentlemen of the town have come to bring you to church .
good cousin , good meg , good ursula , come help me get dressed .
what do you want from me , my good man ?
indeed , sir , it is .
yes , it truly is .
what ’ s the news , my good friends ?
sorry , sir , goodman verges tends to ramble .
thank you for saying that , your worship , but we ’ re just the poor duke ’ s officers .
but truly , if i were as
oh , so you ’ d give me all your tediousness ?
yes , even if i had a thousand more pounds than that , for i hear that you are me , too .
god gives those gifts — i had nothing to do with it .
now i must return to the wedding .
one more thing , sir .
examine them yourselves , then bring me your findings .
now i ’ m in a great hurry , as i ’ m sure you can see .
goodbye .
my lord , they ’ re waiting for you to give your daughter away to claudio .
i ’ m coming .
go to francis seacole , the constable of the watch .
tell him to bring his pen and his inkwell to the jail .
we won ’ t hold back any of our wisdom .
we ’ ll drive them to a
i am being serious , my lord .
thank you .
i ’ m not a man who talks a lot , but i thank you .
if it pleases you , your highness , will you lead us all inside ?
give me your hand , leonato .
we will go in together .
benedick , did you notice signior leonato ’ s daughter ?
i saw her , but i didn ’ t notice her .
isn ’ t she a well-mannered young lady ?
do you want my true opinion ?
or do you want me to criticize her like i do all women ?
no , please , speak seriously .
well , it seems to me that she is too short to be praised highly , too dark to be praised fairly , and too small to be praised greatly .
i can only say this about her : if she looked different than she does , she would be ugly , and since she can ’ t be anything but herself , i don ’ t like her .
you think i ’ m kidding .
please tell me seriously what you think of her .
all right , friar francis , let ’ s keep this short .
no .
no , he comes to be married lady , do you come here to be married to this count ?
i do .
if either of you knows any secret reason why you two should not be joined in marriage , i order you on your souls to say so .
do you know any , hero ?
none , my lord .
do you know any , count ?
i ’ m sure i can answer for him — he doesn ’ t know any , either .
oh , the things men dare to do !
the things men are allowed to do !
the things men do daily , not knowing what they ’ re doing !
what , are we playing with interjections ?
well then , add some interjections that indicate laughter , like hold on , friar .
as freely , son , as god gave her to me .
and what should i give you that would be equal in value to this rare and precious gift ?
nothing , sir , except grandchildren .
there , leonato , take your daughter back .
she only appears honorable from the outside .
look , how she blushes like a virgin !
oh , sin can disguise itself so artfully !
doesn ’ t that rising blush suggest that she is virtuous and innocent ?
all of you who are looking at her , wouldn ’ t you swear that she ’ s a virgin , judging by these outward shows ?
but she is no virgin .
she has been in a man ’ s bed .
she blushes from guilt , not modesty .
what do you mean , my lord ?
and have i ever seemed less than modest or appropriate to you ?
curse you for your false appearances !
is that why you ’ re talking so wildly ?
good prince , say something !
what should i say ?
i ’ ve been dishonored : i arranged for a friend of mine to marry a common whore .
are you really saying these things , or am i dreaming ?
they ’ re really being spoken , sir , and they ’ re true .
this doesn ’ t look like a wedding .
it ’ s true !
oh god !
leonato , am i standing here ?
is this the prince ?
is this the prince ’ s brother ?
is this face hero ’ s ?
are these our eyes ?
yes , that ’ s all true — but what do you mean by it , my lord ?
let me just ask her one question , and by your authority as her father , order her to answer truthfully .
as my child , i order you to do so .
oh , god help me !
what kind of game is this ?
we just want you to answer to your real name .
isn ’ t my name hero ?
who can stain that name with a just accusation ?
indeed , hero herself can !
you ’ ve stained your virtue with your own actions .
what man were you talking to at your window last night , between the hours of midnight and one ?
if you ’ re a virgin , you ’ ll answer this question .
i wasn ’ t talking to any man at that time , my lord .
pretty lady , i ’ m much ashamed of your shocking behavior .
what ’ s wrong , cousin ?
why have you collapsed ?
come , let ’ s go .
these revelations have overwhelmed her .
how is she ?
she ’ s dead , i think . — help , uncle ! — hero , why hero !
uncle !
signior benedick !
friar !
death is the best way to cover over her shame .
how are you , hero ?
yes , why shouldn ’ t she ?
why not !
isn ’ t every living thing condemning her ?
am i sorry that i only had one child ?
do i blame nature for being so thrifty ?
oh , one child is one too many !
why did i ever have one ?
why did you once seem lovely to me ?
why didn ’ t i just adopt a beggar ’ s child left at my doorstep , whose shame and dishonor i could have denied , not being its true father ?
sir , sir , calm down .
i ’ m so amazed by this , i don ’ t know what to say .
oh , on my soul , my cousin has been slandered falsely !
lady , did you sleep in her room last night ?
no , i didn ’ t , but i did every night for the past year .
then it ’ s confirmed !
and in her eyes i see a fire that would seem to burn away the lies the princes have told about her chastity .
but she must be , friar .
you see that any morals she has left are preventing her from denying the charges : she doesn ’ t want to add perjury to her list of sins .
the princes are under some strange misunderstanding .
two of them are completely honorable , and if they have been tricked in this , we must blame john the bastard , who lives to create conflict .
i don ’ t know .
if they have spoken the truth about hero , i will tear her apart with my bare hands .
hold on a moment , and listen to my advice .
the princes left your daughter here for dead .
hide her for a while in your house , and tell everyone that she has , in fact , died .
make a bug show of mourning for her , hang sad epitaphs up at your family ’ s tomb , and perform all the appropriate burial ceremonies .
why should we do this ?
what will this do ?
that will be a good thing .
we ’ ll maintain that she died the instant she was accused , and everyone who hears this will grieve for her , pity her , and excuse her actions .
that ’ s how claudio will respond .
and even if they don ’ t , at least hero ’ s supposed death will stop the rumors of her infidelity .
and if it doesn ’ t go well , then you can keep her hidden in a nunnery , the best place for someone with her kind of dirtied reputation — away from the public ’ s eyes , tongues , mind , and insults .
signior leonato , listen to the friar ’ s plan .
and even though you know i ’ m very close to the prince and claudio , i swear i ’ ll keep your counsel and deal with this secretly and justly .
are you thinking of buying her ?
but tell me , are you speaking seriously ?
or are you just teasing ?
if i ’ m going to sing along with you , i need to know what key you ’ re singing in .
i think she ’ s the most wonderful woman i ’ ve ever laid eyes on .
i ’ m still young enough to see without glasses , and i don ’ t see what you ’ re talking about .
but , hey , this doesn ’ t mean you ’ re looking to get married , does it ?
even if i had sworn never to marry , i wouldn ’ t trust myself to keep that promise if hero would marry me .
what ’ s going on these days ?
isn ’ t there one man left in the world who knows not to take a wife ?
look , don pedro has come back for you .
this is a good agreement .
come , lady ; you must die in order to live .
hopefully , your wedding day is only postponed .
have patience and endure .
lady beatrice , have you been crying this entire time ?
yes , and i ’ ll keep crying a while longer .
i don ’ t wish that on you .
i really believe your cousin was falsely accused .
oh , the man who avenged her could ask anything of me !
is there any way i could show such friendship to you ?
a very clear way , but there is no friend who will undertake it .
can a man do it ?
it ’ s a job meant for a man , but not you .
there is nothing in the world that i love as much as you .
isn ’ t that strange ?
it ’ s as strange as this other thing which i don ’ t understand .
i feel awful for my cousin .
by my sword , beatrice , you love me .
not with any sauce they could provide for them .
i swear , i love you .
well then , god forgive me !
why , what have you done , sweet beatrice ?
you got to me first .
i was about to swear that i loved you .
then do so , with all your heart .
i love you with so much of my heart that none of it is left to protest with .
come , ask me to do anything for you .
kill claudio .
ha !
i wouldn ’ t do that for the whole wide world .
then , rejecting my request , you kill
wait , sweet beatrice .
my body waits here , but the rest of me is gone .
you don ’ t really love me .
i beg you to let me go .
beatrice — i swear , i ’ m going .
not until we part as friends .
how dare you try to be my friend when you refuse to fight my enemy .
is claudio your enemy ?
hasn ’ t he proven himself to be a great villain — slandering , scorning , and dishonoring my cousin ?
oh , i wish i were a man !
he pretended that everything was fine until the moment they were exchanging vows , and then — with public accusation , blatant slander , pure hatred — oh god , if only i were a man !
i would rip his heart out in public and eat it .
listen to me , beatrice — talking with a man outside her bedroom window !
a likely story !
no , but beatrice — sweet hero , she ’ s been wronged , she ’ s been slandered , she ’ s been ruined .
beat —
princes and counts !
he ’ s a proper count , that count sugarplum , a sweet gentleman , for sure !
oh , if only i were a man !
or had a friend who would be a man for me !
all this conversing has turned men into tongues — and fancy ones , at that .
the man who tells a lie and swears by it is now considered as brave as hercules .
i can ’ t make myself a man by wishing i were , so as a woman i ’ ll die , from grieving .
wait , good beatrice .
i swear by this hand that i love you .
don ’ t just swear by it ; put your hand to some use that will prove you love me .
that ’ s enough for me , then .
i ’ ll challenge him .
i ’ ll kiss your hand , and with that i leave you .
i swear that claudio will pay dearly for this .
keep me in your thoughts and go comfort your cousin .
which ones are the malefactors ?
sir , that would be me and my partner .
have them come in front of the master constable .
yes , indeed , bring them before me .
what ’ s your name , friend ?
borachio .
please , write down “ borachio . ” — and yours ?
i ’ m a gentleman , sir , and my name is conrade .
write down “ master gentleman conrade . ” — gentlemen , are you good christians , and do you serve god ?
yes , sir , we hope so .
how do you both plead ?
honestly , sir , we say that we are not criminals .
he ’ s a marvelously witty fellow , no doubt , but i ’ ll outmaneuver him . — come over here ; i ’ ll whisper a word in your ear .
sir , i tell you we believe you ’ re both lying criminals .
sir , i tell you that we are not .
well , okay . — i swear to god , both their stories match .
have you written that down , that they aren ’ t criminals ?
master constable , you ’ re going about this all wrong .
first , you have to speak to the watchmen who accused them .
yes , good idea ; that ’ s the
this man said , sir , that don john , the prince ’ s brother , was a villain .
write down that prince john is a villain .
i swear , i don ’ t like the look of you .
that don john had given him a thousand pieces of gold for wrongfully accusing the lady hero .
that ’ s burglary , that is .
yes , by god , that it is .
what else did you hear ?
what else ?
that ’ s all .
i ’ ll get there first and tell him what we found out .
honest to god , where ’ s the sexton ?
come on , tie them up .
get away from me , you ass !
you ass !
don ’ t you suspect my office ?
don ’ t you
if you keep on the way you ’ ve been going , you ’ ll kill yourself .
stop advising me ; your words pass through my ears like water through a sieve .
find a father who loved his child as overwhelmingly as i loved hero and ask
so don ’ t advise me .
please , leave me alone .
i intend to be flesh and blood , not airy philosophy , for there has never yet been a philosopher who could endure a toothache patiently , even though they all write as if they had risen above human suffering and misfortune .
but don ’ t take all that pain on yourself .
make sure the ones who have wronged you suffer too .
now you ’ re talking .
i definitely will .
in my soul , i believe hero has been falsely accused .
the prince and claudio are hurrying this way .
good evening , good evening .
good day to both of you .
listen , my lords — we ’ re in a bit of a hurry , leonato .
your highness will have to force me to tell .
it ’ s good if you love hero , because she ’ s worthy of your love .
you ’ re trying to trick me , my lord .
i swear , i ’ m telling you what i honestly think .
a bit of a hurry , my lord !
well then , good bye , my lord .
you ’ re in a hurry , are you ?
well then , don ’ t bother .
come on , don ’ t quarrel with us , good old man .
if it ’ s fighting he is after , some of us here should run and hide .
who has wronged him ?
indeed , you have wronged me , you liar .
don ’ t bother trying to intimidate me by putting your hand on your sword .
i ’ m not scared of you .
curse my hand if it ever threatened an old man like you .
really , i had no intention of going for my sword .
damn you , don ’ t mock and sneer at me .
i ’ m not a doddering old fool who brags about the things he did when he was young , and what he would do now if he weren ’ t so old .
claudio , i ’ m telling you right to your face that you have wronged me and my innocent child .
you have ruined my innocent child .
your slander has broken her heart , and now she lies buried with her ancestors in a tomb — ancestors who had never been tainted by scandal until you caused one with your wickedness .
my wickedness ?
yours , claudio , yours , i say .
you ’ ve got it wrong , old man .
i ’ ll beat him despite his fancy fencing techniques and all the practicing he does , despite his youth and manliness .
not a chance !
i ’ ll have nothing to do with you .
you think you can get rid of me that easily ?
you killed my child .
take on someone your own size : if you kill me , boy , you ’ ll have killed a man .
he ’ ll have to kill both of us , and indeed we ’ re both men .
but let him start off easy by killing one of us .
come on — kill me and brag about it !
let me at him .
i will , as surely as i am a gentleman .
brother — quiet .
god knows i loved my niece , and now she ’ s dead — slandered to death by cowards who would just as likely fight a real man as i would grab a poisonous snake by the tongue .
brother anthony —
hold your peace .
but brother anthony — don ’ t , it ’ s no big deal .
don ’ t bother with it .
let me deal with this .
gentlemen , we won ’ t stay here and anger you further .
i ’ m sorry about your daughter ’ s death , but i swear our accusations were true , and backed up with proof .
my lord , my lord — i don ’ t want to hear any more about it .
no ?
come on , brother !
i ’ m determined to be heard by someone .
and you will be , or some people here will suffer for it .
look , here comes just the man we were looking for .
what ’ s up , mister ?
welcome , sir .
you just missed a fight that was barely avoided .
we were about to have our noses snapped off by two old men with no teeth .
leonato and his brother .
what do you think ?
i think if we had fought , we would have proven too young and strong for them after all .
there ’ s no bravery in an unfair fight .
look : benedick is so pale — are you sick , or angry ?
lighten up .
sir , don ’ t even try to beat me in a battle of wits .
i ’ ll meet all your attacks , even if you come charging at me with a lance at full gallop .
choose another tack .
i think he really is angry .
if he is , that ’ s his problem .
can i have a word with you privately ?
god forbid he wants to challenge me !
lain .
you ’ ve killed an innocent woman , and you ’ re going to pay dearly for her death .
what do you say ?
what , are we having a feast ?
yes , we are .
benedick , beatrice praised your wit the other day .
i said you had a fine wit .
that she did .
and yet for all that , if she didn ’ t hate him to death , she ’ d love him to death .
leonato ’ s daughter had told us everything .
absolutely everything .
and , moreover , god saw benedick when he was hid in the garden .
but when exactly will we see benedick married ?
yes , with the sign underneath him that says : “ here lives benedick the married man ” ?
goodbye , boy .
you know what i intend .
i ’ ll leave you now to chatter and gossip like an old woman .
the wit you flaunt is like a blunt sword — it can ’ t hurt anyone , thank god . — my lord , i thank you for your many kindnesses .
i ’ m leaving your court now .
your brother don john the bastard has run away from messina .
the three of you have killed a sweet , innocent woman .
lord babyface over there will meet me in a duel , and good luck to him then .
he ’ s serious .
very serious , and i ’ m sure it ’ s because of beatrice .
and he challenged you to a duel ?
he did , very sincerely .
what a strange sight — a man who has put on all his fancy clothes but forgotten his brain at home !
a guy like that is bigger than an ape , but the ape could be his doctor , it ’ s so much smarter .
but wait a minute .
let me gather my wits and get serious here .
didn ’ t he say my brother has run away ?
come on , you .
if they let you off , then we ’ ll have to assume that lady justice has lost all her power .
since you are a lying hypocrite , we must look after you .
what ’ s this ?
two of my brother ’ s men , all tied up !
officers , what crime have these men committed ?
i tricked your own eyes .
they ’ ve recorded my crimes , and i would rather die than have to retell this shameful story .
the lady has died because of the false accusations of me and my master .
his words are like poison to me .
yes , and paid me well for doing it .
he is made of treachery , and has run away to avoid his crimes .
sweet hero ; when i imagine you now , you seem as beautiful as you did when i first loved you .
come , take away the here comes master signior leonato with the sexton .
which one of them did it ?
let me see what he looks like , so when i see another man who resembles him , i ’ ll know to avoid him .
which one is it ?
if you want to see your deceiver , then look at me .
are you the slave who , with your slanderous words , killed my innocent child ?
yes , i am the one .
no , villain , but you didn ’ t work alone .
i don ’ t know how to ask you for forgiveness , but i have to say something .
choose your revenge .
i can ’ t ask you to make my daughter live — that ’ s impossible — but i beg you both to tell the people of messina that she was innocent when she died .
and if your love can produce something from its sadness , write a poem for her ; hang it on her grave and sing it to her bones .
sing it tonight .
then come to my house tomorrow morning , and since you couldn ’ t be my son-in-law , be my nephew instead .
my brother has a daughter who looks exactly like hero ; this girl is heir to both our estates .
marry her as you should have married her cousin , and i will let my revenge die .
and i feel that i love her .
i know that she is worthy of that love .
or in the power of reason .
i was conceived by a woman , and i thank her very much for all her effort .
and then she brought me up , and i thank her for that , too .
i swear , before i die i ’ m going to see you sick with love .
with anger , with fever , or with hunger , sure , my friend , but never sick with love .
oh , noble sir !
your overwhelming kindness makes me weep .
i willingly accept your offer and put my future in your hands .
i will see you tomorrow , then .
now i have to leave .
this wicked man will be brought face to face with margaret , who i believe was hired by don john to take part in this plot .
thank you for all your efforts .
you speak like a very thankful and respectful boy , and may god bless you .
god save the charitable organization !
i leave a slimy bastard with you , your worship , for you to punish and make an example of .
god bless your worship !
i wish you well .
i hope that god restores you to health .
goodbye , gentlemen .
we ’ ll see you tomorrow .
we ’ ll be there .
i will mourn hero tonight .
please margaret , help me write this poem for beatrice .
you certainly deserve it .
it ’ s just that my wit is very gentlemanly , margaret , and refuses to hurt a woman .
now please , tell beatrice to come out .
i ’ ll go get beatrice for you , who can walk here by herself — she has legs .
so that means she ’ ll come .
i ’ m really a pitiful singer .
take beatrice , have you come because i called for you ?
yes , sir , and i ’ ll leave when you ask me to .
oh , well , stay till then !
i spoke angry , foul words to him , and with that i will kiss you .
if you had foul words in your mouth , then your breath must be foul , and foul breath is nauseating .
thus , i ’ ll leave without being kissed .
your wit is so forceful , it frightens the very meaning out of your words .
but i will tell you this very plainly : i have challenged claudio , and either he ’ ll accept the challenge or admit he ’ s a coward .
now , tell me — which of my bad qualities did you fall in love with first ?
with all of them at once : they work together to create such an entirely evil person that no good ever manages to enter the mix .
but tell me — which of my good qualities first made you suffer love for me ?
suffer love !
that ’ s a good way of putting it .
i do suffer love , because i love you against my will .
you love me in spite of your heart , i think .
in this day and age , if a man doesn ’ t erect his own monument before he dies , he won ’ t be remembered past the funeral bell ’ s ringing and his widow ’ s crying .
exactly how long is that , do you think ?
about an hour for the ringing and fifteen minutes for the crying .
that ’ s why it ’ s better for wise men to trumpet their own virtues , like i do .
that ’ s why i praise myself , who — if i do say so myself — is quite praiseworthy .
but tell me , how is your cousin ?
i ’ m very sick , too .
have faith , love me , and you will get better .
madam , you have to go to your uncle ’ s .
it ’ s been proven that lady hero is innocent , that the prince and claudio have been utterly deceived , and that don john — who has run away — is the source of all the trouble .
will you come immediately ?
will you come with me to hear this news , sir ?
i will live in your heart , die in your lap , and be buried in your eyes — and , what ’ s more , i will go with you to your uncle ’ s .
is this the family tomb of leonato ?
it is , my lord .
here lies hero , the heroic maiden killed by slanderous words .
to repay her for her troubles , death gives her undying fame .
so the life that died with shame lives on with fame .
this epitaph will hang here forever , continuing to praise hero after i die .
now start the music , and sing the solemn hymn .
now i say good night to your bones , hero .
i will perform this ceremony every year .
good morning , gentlemen .
put out your torches .
the wolves have finished preying for the night , and look — the gentle dawn is rising , dappling the sleepy eastern sky with spots of light .
good morning , gentlemen .
didn ’ t i tell you she was innocent ?
and the prince and claudio , who accused her , are innocent as well , because they were deceived by don john .
well , i ’ m glad that everything has been sorted out .
me too — otherwise i would have had to duel with claudio .
when i send for you , come out wearing masks .
the prince and claudio are supposed to be here by now . — you know your job , brother .
you have to pretend to be your niece ’ s father , and give her away to claudio .
what do you need me to do ?
she sees you with the eyes my daughter lent her , it ’ s true .
and i see her also through the eyes of love .
and those eyes were endowed with sight by claudio , the prince , and me .
but what did you want ?
sir , i ’ m puzzled by what you just said .
and i ’ ll help you .
here comes the prince and claudio .
good morning to all these lovely people .
good morning , prince ; good morning , claudio .
we ’ re waiting here for you .
are you still set on marrying my brother ’ s daughter ?
i wouldn ’ t change my mind even if she were
well , time will tell .
just you wait .
give him my respects , and tell him i ’ ll definitely be there for dinner , since i know he has gone to great lengths for this meal .
bring her out , brother .
the friar ’ s ready .
good morning , benedick .
i think he ’ s nervous — he ’ s about to become the savage bull who got domesticated .
oh , don ’ t worry about it — we ’ ll dip your i ’ ll get you for that one .
but here are other matters to be dealt with .
which is the lady i ’ m supposed to marry ?
this one , and i will give her to you .
no , you can ’ t do that until you take her hand and , in front of this friar , swear to marry her .
it ’ s another hero !
exactly right .
and as surely as i am alive , i am a virgin .
it ’ s the former hero !
the hero that died !
she was only dead , my lord , as long as her slander lived .
i can confirm that all these shocking things are true .
which one of you is beatrice ?
do you love me ?
no , no more than is reasonable .
well then , your uncle and the prince and claudio have been deceived .
they swore you did .
do you love me ?
truly , no — no more than is reasonable .
well then , margaret , ursula , and my cousin have been very much deceived , for they swore you did .
they swore that you were sick with love for me .
they swore that you were nearly dead with love for me .
oh , well .
so you don ’ t love me ?
no , i don ’ t — except as a friend .
come on , niece , i ’ m sure you love him .
and here ’ s another poem , which i stole from my cousin ’ s pocket — in her handwriting and all about her adoration for benedick .
what a miracle !
our handwriting gives away our hearts .
come on , i ’ ll take you , but honestly i ’ m only doing it out of pity .
i won ’ t say no to you , but let it be known that i ’ m only doing this after a lot of persuasion and to save your life — i hear you were quickly wasting away without me .
oh , shut up !
i ’ ll stop your mouth with a kiss .
how does it feel to be benedick the married man ?
i ’ ll tell you what , prince : a whole university full of wisecrackers couldn ’ t change my mood today .
you think i care what i ’ m called ?
well , i don ’ t .
no , before !
musicians , play us a song . — prince , you look sad .
you should get a wife !
into god ’ s hands .
from my house , if i had a house — ” “ the sixth of july .
before you make my lord , you could really help me out now .
i am at your service .
just tell me what you want me to do , and however hard it is , you ’ ll see that i ’ m eager to do it .
does leonato have a son , my lord ?
hero is his only child , and his only heir .
do you like her , claudio ?
look , if you really love the beautiful hero , enjoy it .
isn ’ t that the reason you told me all this ?
but i didn ’ t want you to think that i ’ m hasty in my emotions .
that ’ s like building a bridge wider than the river it crosses .
i ’ ll disguise myself as you and pour out “ my ” feelings to hero , taking her prisoner with the force of my love story .
let ’ s get started right away .
has he taken care of the music ?
he is taking care of it as we speak .
but brother , i have some strange news for you .
is it good news ?
is this servant of yours a smart man ?
he ’ s very bright .
i ’ ll get him to come here , and you can ask him yourself .
he must be very near by now .
when i left him , he was less than nine miles from here .
how many noblemen were killed in the battle you just fought ?
not many , and no one important .
a victory in battle is twice as victorious when all the soldiers return home safely .
claudio deserves to be honored , and don pedro has rewarded him accordingly .
he has an uncle here in messina who will be glad to hear this news .
no , no , until it comes true we ’ ll pretend it was just a dream we had .
but my daughter should know about this , so she can be prepared with an answer just in case .
go to her and tell her for me .
cousins , you all have work to do . — oh , i beg your pardon .
come with me now , and help me out .
really , my lord , why are you so excessively sad ?
therefore my sadness is without limit .
you should listen to reason .
i can ’ t hide what i am .
sure , but don ’ t do it at full volume until there ’ s no danger in it .
not long ago you challenged and opposed your brother , and it is only very recently that he has forgiven you .
you have to wait for the appropriate time to let loose .
i ’ d rather be a weed in a hedge than a rose in my brother ’ s garden .
though i am not a flattering , righteous man , at least you can say that i am honest about being a villain .
until that happens , let me be who i am and don ’ t try to change me .
can ’ t you somehow use your dissatisfaction to your own advantage ?
i use it all the time , since it ’ s all that i have .
who ’ s that ?
what ’ s going on , borachio ?
who is this fool who wants all the fuss of marriage ?
your brother ’ s right-hand man .
who ?
that pretty boy , claudio ?
that ’ s the one .
hero , the daughter and heir of leonato .
a lively young one !
how did you learn about this ?
as i was working on one musty room , the prince and claudio entered .
come , let ’ s go to the dance .
this just may cheer me up .
if there ’ s any way i can spoil his life , i ’ ll be overjoyed .
you ’ ll both help me , right ?
until the day we die , my lord .
let ’ s go to this great feast .
lead the way , sir .
wasn ’ t don john at dinner tonight ?
i didn ’ t see him .
that man always looks so sour !
just looking at him gives me heartburn .
he has a very gloomy attitude .
it would be excellent if they could make a man halfway between don john and benedick .
one of them is too much like a painting of a man — he never speaks — and the other is too much like a spoiled little boy , always chattering .
really , niece , you ’ ll never get a husband if you keep saying such harsh things about people .
honestly , she is too ill-tempered .
maybe you will find a husband without a beard .
and then what would i do with him ?
so you ’ ll go to hell ?
he will show me the part of heaven where the bachelors sit , and i ’ ll have fun there forever .
no , i won ’ t take a husband until they make men out of something other than dirt .
what woman wouldn ’ t be distressed , being lorded over by a handful of dust ?
can you imagine being hitched to a lump of clay ?
no , uncle , i won ’ t be married .
if he is too insistent , tell him that romance is like a dance : it has its own rhythm and timing .
the wooing is like a scottish jig : hot and fast and full of whimsy and illusion .
niece , you are exceptionally perceptive .
i have a good eye , uncle .
i can see what ’ s in broad daylight .
the partygoers have arrived .
let ’ s give them room .
my lady , will you have a dance with me ?
as long as you move gracefully , look handsome , and say nothing , i ’ m yours for the dance .
and when will that be ?
when i like the way you look , for god forbid your face be as ugly as your mask !
my mask is like the roof of the poor
if you wish to speak of love , speak more softly .
well , i wish you liked me .
tell me one .
i say my prayers out loud .
that makes me love you even more .
amen .
go ahead — say “ amen . ” no more talking .
i ’ ve got my answer .
no , really , i ’ m not .
i can tell by the way you waggle your head .
really , i ’ m only pretending to be him .
you could only imitate his imperfections so well if you were the man himself .
look , you ’ ve got his wrinkled hands .
you are antonio , you are he .
in short , i ’ m not .
come on , do you think i can ’ t recognize you by your excellent wit ?
can a good thing hide itself ?
be quiet , you are antonio .
a man ’ s virtues will always show themselves , and that ’ s the end of that .
won ’ t you tell me who told you that ?
no , you ’ ll have to excuse me .
and you won ’ t tell me who you are ?
not now .
who said that i was disdainful , and that i got all my best lines out of a bad joke book ? !
well , it must have been signior benedick .
who ’ s that ?
i ’ m sure you know him .
no i don ’ t , believe me .
what , he never made you laugh ?
yes , heavily .
there ’ s no face more sincere than one washed in tears .
and it ’ s definitely better to cry because you ’ re happy than laugh because you ’ re sad !
there was no signior montanto in our army .
who are you talking about , niece ?
my cousin means signior benedick of padua .
oh , yes , benedick has returned and is as cheerful as ever .
please tell me , who is this man ?
why , he ’ s the prince ’ s fool , and a very dull fool at that .
i ’ m sure he ’ s out there dancing .
i could have sworn he trampled on me .
when i meet this gentleman , i ’ ll tell him what you ’ ve said .
oh , please do .
and that will save a partridge wing from being eaten , because he ’ ll be too miserable for dinner .
come on , we have to follow the leaders of the dance .
in every good thing they do .
no , if they try to lead us to harm , i will leave the dance floor at the next song .
that ’ s claudio .
you know me too well .
i am benedick .
sir , my brother is very fond of you .
he is in love with hero .
please make him change his mind .
how do you know he loves her ?
i heard him swear he did .
i did too , and he also swore he would marry her tonight .
come on , let ’ s get to the banquet .
though i said my name was benedick , i heard this news with claudio ’ s ears .
of course the prince wants hero for himself .
friendship is enduring except when love is involved .
therefore , all lovers should speak for themselves .
beauty is a witch whose spells can turn loyalty into passion .
goodbye then , hero .
claudio ?
yes , that ’ s me .
will you come with me ?
where ?
right over to that i hope he enjoys her .
you sound like a cattle dealer : that ’ s the way they sell bulls .
but do you really think the prince would treat you that way ?
please , leave me alone .
look at you , thrashing about like a blind man .
a boy robbed you , but you ’ ll beat up the post instead .
if you won ’ t leave , then
oh , the poor bird .
but how strange that beatrice should seem to know who i was and yet not know at the same time .
the prince ’ s fool ” !
maybe they call me that because i am cheerful .
yes , but i am insulting myself by thinking this way .
i don ’ t have that kind of reputation !
well , i ’ ll get my revenge .
now , sir , where is claudio ?
did you see him ?
yes , my lord , i played the part of a gossip and brought him the news .
i found him here , beating ?
why , what did he do ?
he was like a schoolboy who finds a bird ’ s nest and happily shows it to his friend , who then steals it from him .
what , is trusting a friend such a crime ?
the criminal is the one who stole the nest .
lady beatrice is angry with you .
the gentleman she danced with told her you insulted her .
she speaks daggers , and every word stabs .
if her breath were as terrible as her words , she would kill every living thing from here to the furthest star .
i wouldn ’ t marry her , even if she were as blessed as paradise .
please , don ’ t mention her .
look , here she comes .
your highness , could you send me on a mission to the ends of the earth ?
i ’ ll go to the antipodes for any little errand you can think of .
really , he won it from me once before in a dishonest game of dice .
so i suppose your grace can truly say that i have lost it .
you ’ ve humiliated him , lady : you ’ ve put him down .
why are you so sad ?
i ’ m not sad , my lord .
what then , sick ?
i ’ m neither , my lord .
the count is neither sad nor sick nor cheerful nor well — he ’ s just civil , as seville as an orange , with the same jealous-yellow complexion .
i ’ ve told her father , and he ’ s given his permission .
tell us when you wish to get married , and may god give you joy .
claudio , take my daughter , and , with her , take my fortunes .
the prince has made the match , and may god bless it .
speak , claudio , that ’ s your cue .
for you , i give myself away and i ’ m ecstatic about the exchange .
truly , lady , you have a merry heart .
yes , my lord .
i thank my heart — the poor fool — for it keeps away from seriousness .
look , my cousin is whispering to claudio that she loves him .
why , you ’ re absolutely right , cousin .
thank the lord for alliances !
so everyone goes off into the world except me , who stays in because i ’ m sunburned .
i should sit in the corner and sing that song , “ heigh-ho for a husband ! ” lady beatrice , i ’ ll get you a husband .
i ’ d rather get a husband from your father .
don ’ t you have any brothers like you ?
your father ’ s sons would make excellent husbands , if only a girl could catch one for herself .
will you take me , my lady ?
no , my lord , unless i could have another husband for the work week .
you are too expensive to wear every day .
but please , forgive me , your highness .
i was born to speak cleverly , not seriously .
niece , will you take care of those things i mentioned ?
oh , yes , i ’ m sorry , uncle . — if you ’ ll excuse me , your grace .
i swear , she ’ s a very good-natured lady .
there ’ s very little about her that ’ s gloomy , my lord .
she ’ s only sad when she sleeps — and not even then .
she can ’ t stand to hear about getting a husband .
no , not at all .
she mocks all her suitors so severely that they drop the suit .
she would make a good wife for benedick .
oh , lord , if they were married , they ’ d drive themselves crazy within a week .
count claudio , when do you plan to go to church and be married ?
tomorrow , my lord .
my lord , i will help you , even if it means i have to stay awake for ten nights straight .
me too , my lord .
and you , sweet hero ?
i ’ ll do any decent thing , my lord , to help my cousin get a good husband .
and benedick is not the worst husband i can think of .
this much i can say about him : he is well-born , has proven his bravery in battle , and has established his good character .
come inside with me , and i will tell you my plan .
but i ’ m sure he ’ ll get even with you .
signior benedick served well in the war , my lady .
you had rotten food , and he helped you eat it .
he ’ s a good soldier too , lady .
he ’ s a lord to a lord and a man to a man .
he is positively stuffed with honorable virtues .
absolutely — he is stuffed , like a dummy .
please don ’ t take my niece the wrong way , sir .
benedick and beatrice have been waging a war of wits between themselves .
whenever they meet , there ’ s a little battle .
every month he has a new best friend .
is that possible ?
it ’ s arranged .
the count claudio will marry leonato ’ s daughter .
yes , my lord , but i can spoil it .
any obstacle or barrier to claudio ’ s happiness will be like medicine to me .
i hate him so much it makes me sick , and whoever can ruin his happiness will make me happy .
how will you wreck this marriage ?
i can only do it by lying , my lord , but i can do it so secretly that no one will suspect me .
quickly , tell me how .
i think it was a year ago that i told you how much margaret , hero ’ s servant woman , likes me .
i remember .
i can arrange it so that at some indecent hour of the night , she looks out hero ’ s bedroom window .
how will that kill this marriage ?
that part is up to you .
what will be my evidence ?
evidence enough to deceive the prince , anger claudio , ruin hero , and kill leonato .
is there anything else you wish ?
that ’ s all i want , and i ’ ll do anything to accomplish it .
find a time to speak with don pedro and claudio alone .
tell them you know that hero loves me .
of course , they won ’ t believe you without proof .
if you make the accusation convincingly , then my cunning won ’ t fail me .
i ’ ll go now to find out the date of the wedding .
boy !
yes signior ?
in my bedroom window there is a book .
go get it and bring it to me here in the orchard .
i ’ m already here , sir .
i see that you are here , but i ’ d like you to go there and then come back again .
i knew him when he listened to nothing but the military drum and fife ; now he would rather hear the sweet and refined music of the tabor and pipe .
i knew him when he would ’ ve walked ten miles to see a well-crafted suit of armor ; now he spends ten nights awake in his room designing himself a fancy new jacket .
i ’ m not sure , but i don ’ t think so .
i can ’ t promise that love won ’ t transform me , but i can promise you this : until i truly fall in love , a woman will never make me act like such a fool .
ha !
look , it ’ s the prince and mr. love .
i ’ ll hide in the arbor .
well , should we hear some music ?
yes , my lord .
come on , balthasar , let ’ s hear that song again .
oh , my good lord , don ’ t make me insult music again with my awful singing .
come on , please sing .
just know this before i begin : i can ’ t play a single note that ’ s worthy of note .
listen to him speaking in quarter notes !
that ’ s a good song .
and a bad singer , my lord .
yes , do you hear me , balthasar ?
please , get some excellent music , because tomorrow we want to serenade lady hero at her bedroom window .
i ’ ll do the best i can , my lord .
please do .
goodbye .
come here , leonato .
what was it that you told me today — that your niece beatrice was in love with signior benedick ?
oh yes .
i didn ’ t , either .
but how wonderful that she should be so fond of signior benedick , whom she has always appeared to hate .
really , my lord , i don ’ t know what to make of it , but she loves him with such a passion that it ’ s past all understanding .
maybe she ’ s just pretending .
yes , that ’ s quite likely .
oh god !
pretending ?
no one has ever faked passion as skillfully as this , then .
why , what symptoms of love does she exhibit ?
what symptoms , my lord ?
she will have a seat — you heard my daughter tell you how .
yes , she did tell us .
please , please tell me !
this is amazing .
i would have thought she was invincible against any assault of love .
i would have sworn that , too , my lord , especially against benedick .
has she told benedick how she feels ?
no , and she swears she never will .
that ’ s what ’ s driving her crazy .
it ’ s true , hero says so .
my daughter told me everything .
now that you speak of paper , i remember a funny story of hero ’ s .
oh , you mean when beatrice writes a letter and hero sees that it has “ benedick ” and “ beatrice ” written all over it ?
yes , that ’ s the one .
oh , she tears that letter into a thousand small pieces and berates herself for being so forward as to write a letter to a man she knows would mock her .
it ’ s true .
if she won ’ t tell benedick , someone else should .
and what would that accomplish ?
he ’ ll just turn it into a joke and torment the poor woman even more .
if he did that , it would be a charitable deed to hang him .
she ’ s an excellent , sweet woman , and there ’ s no doubt that she is virtuous .
and she is very smart .
oh , my lord , when wisdom and passion are in one body , it ’ s ten to one that the passion will win .
i am sorry for her , as i should be , since i am both her uncle and her guardian .
i wish she were in love with me instead .
i would have thrown away all other considerations and made her my wife .
please , tell benedick about her feelings and see what he has to say .
is that a good idea , do you think ?
she ’ s probably right .
if she offers him her love , it ’ s very possible that he ’ ll scorn it , since , as we all know , he tends to be contemptuous .
he ’ s a very proper man .
and i swear to god he ’ s very smart .
he does indeed show sparks of something like wit .
it ’ s entirely possible .
i can see you don ’ t like this gentleman .
no , absolutely not .
but please tell me , who ’ s his best friend ?
he spends most of his time with the good , noble claudio .
oh god , benedick will plague him like a disease !
god help claudio !
if he ’ s caught the benedick , he ’ ll lose all his money before he ’ s cured .
i ’ m going to make sure i stay on your good side , lady .
do that , my friend .
you will never fall victim to benedick ’ s charms , my niece .
no , not until we see a hot january .
don pedro is here .
if he fears god , he must necessarily keep the peace .
if he breaks the peace , he ought to enter into a quarrel with fear and trembling .
well , i ’ m sorry for your niece .
should we go find benedick and tell him about beatrice ’ s love ?
against my will , i ’ ve been told to bring you in to dinner .
lovely beatrice , i thank you for taking the pains to tell me that .
i didn ’ t take any more pains bringing this message than you took pains in thanking me .
if the job had been painful , i would not have come .
so you took pleasure in bringing me this message ?
yes , as much pleasure as one might take in choking a bird at knifepoint .
you don ’ t want to eat , sir ?
goodbye , then .
ha !
against my will , i ’ ve been told to bring you in to dinner . ” there ’ s a double meaning in that .
if i don ’ t love her , i ’ m completely
margaret , run into the sitting room .
you ’ ll find beatrice there , talking to claudio and the prince .
whisper to her that ursula and i are walking in the orchard and that we ’ re talking all about her .
tell her you heard us , and that she should sneak into the arbor where the crisscrossing branches overhead keep the honeysuckles out of the sun .
she can hide there and eavesdrop on our conversation .
this is your job .
do it well , and then leave us .
i ’ ll make her come right away , i promise you .
all right ursula , as beatrice arrives , we ’ ll be walking up and down this alley and speaking about nothing but benedick .
whenever i mention him , praise him more than any man deserves .
it ’ ll be my job to talk about how benedick is sick with love for beatrice .
let ’ s start .
but are you sure that benedick loves beatrice that much ?
that ’ s what the prince and my fiancé say .
and did they ask you to tell beatrice about this , madam ?
they did want me to tell her , but i persuaded them that , if they truly loved benedick , they would try to get him to battle his emotions and keep beatrice in the dark .
why did you do that ?
doesn ’ t benedick deserve as much luck with a mate as he would have with beatrice ?
what ’ s the matter , lieutenant ?
i ’ ll beat him until the welts look like basket-weave !
you ’ ll beat me ?
are you talking , you villain ?
no , don ’ t hit him , lieutenant !
please , sir , restrain yourself .
let me go , or i ’ ll knock you on the head .
come on , you ’ re drunk .
drunk ?
no , lieutenant — god , gentlemen — help — lieutenant — sir , montano — help , men ! — the night guard is coming !
who ’ s sounding that alarm ?
the whole town will riot !
you ’ ll be ashamed of this forever !
what is the matter here ?
i ’ ll kill him !
stop right now !
stop !
stop !
the general is talking to you !
stop , for god ’ s sake !
for heaven ’ s sake , stop this savage brawl !
the next man who swings his sword must not care about his life , because the instant he strikes , he dies .
stop that alarm from ringing , it ’ s scaring the islanders .
what ’ s the matter here , gentlemen ? — honest iago , you look upset .
answer me .
i don ’ t know .
i don ’ t
i ’ d rather have lost my legs in battle than be a part of this !
you ’ re famous for it .
what in the world made you risk your reputation like this and become a street brawler ?
tell me .
othello , i ’ ve been seriously hurt .
i didn ’ t do anything wrong that i know of , unless it was a sin to defend myself when someone attacked me .
all right , now i ’ m starting to lose my cool .
that ’ s unbelievably bad .
iago , who started it ?
you ’ re hitting close to home there .
i ’ d rather cut my tongue out of my mouth than say anything bad about michael cassio .
but i don ’ t think it ’ ll hurt him to tell the truth .
they were nearly killing each other , as you saw when you pulled them apart .
i can ’ t tell you anything else .
cassio was wrong to hurt montano , who was only trying to help him , but i ’ m sure the guy who ran away must have offended cassio in some terrible way , and cassio couldn ’ t let it pass .
i ’ ll make you an example for the others to learn from .
what ’ s the matter , dear ?
everything ’ s fine , now , sweetheart .
are you hurt , lieutenant ?
yes , but no doctor can help me .
oh i hope that ’ s not true !
you know i ’ m powerful enough to make you pay for this .
please wait , sir .
why are you talking about robbery ?
we come here to help you and you treat us like thugs , but you let an african horse climb all over your daughter .
your grandsons will neigh to you like horses .
your whole family will be ruined .
what kind of crude jerk are you ?
the kind that tells you that the moor is having sex with your daughter right now .
you ’ re a villain !
you ’ re a senator !
you ’ re going to pay for this , roderigo .
i know who you are .
i ’ ll answer for everything .
my reputation , my reputation !
oh , my reputation , iago , my reputation !
i swear i thought you meant you ’ d been hurt physically .
your physical health matters more than your reputation .
you haven ’ t lost it unless you think you have .
there are lots of ways to get on the general ’ s good side again .
go to him , petition him .
drunk ?
babbling senselessly ?
squabbling ?
swaggering ?
ranting and raving to my own shadow !
oh , wine is the devil !
who were you chasing with your sword ?
what did he do to you ?
i don ’ t know .
is that possible ?
i remember a jumble of impressions , but nothing distinctly .
i remember a fight , but not why we were fighting .
why do we party until we ’ re like animals ?
you seem all right now .
how did you get better ?
one weakness led to another , to make me hate myself .
come on , you ’ re being too hard on yourself .
i wish none of this had happened , given the situation here , and your rank .
but since this has happened , you should fix it for your own good .
i ’ ll ask him for my position back again , and he ’ ll tell me i ’ m a drunk .
even if i had a whole bunch of mouths , i wouldn ’ t be able to answer that .
i was a reasonable man , then i became a fool , and finally a beast !
oh , how strange !
every glass of liquor is damned , and the devil ’ s the main ingredient !
come on now , wine is good for you , if you know how to use it .
don ’ t say anything bad about wine anymore .
lieutenant , i think you know i ’ m your friend .
i know that , sir .
imagine , me , a drunk !
any man can get drunk sometime .
i ’ ll tell you what to do .
othello ’ s wife has a lot of influence now .
ask her to help you get back your position .
she is so generous , kind , and ready to help that she thinks it ’ s wrong not to do everything she can , even more than she is asked to do .
ask her to help you heal the rift between her husband and you .
that ’ s good advice .
i believe it completely .
early in the morning i ’ ll go visit desdemona and plead my case .
my situation is desperate .
you ’ re doing the right thing .
good night , lieutenant .
good night , honest iago .
who can say i ’ m evil when my advice is so good ?
that ’ s really the best way to win the moor back again .
it ’ s easy to get desdemona on your side .
she ’ s full of good intentions .
how am i evil to advise cassio to do exactly what ’ ll do him good ?
when devils are about to commit their biggest sins they put on their most heavenly faces , just like i ’ m doing now .
the more she
and that ’ s how i ’ ll turn her good intentions into a big trap to snag them all .
hello , roderigo !
i ’ ve spent most of my money , and tonight i got beaten up .
so with no money , but a little more wisdom , i ’ m going back to venice .
you ’ re a poor man if you ’ re this impatient !
no , it heals gradually .
we achieve things with our intelligence , not by magic , and intelligent planning takes time .
aren ’ t things going well ?
my god , it ’ s morning .
all this excitement has made the time fly by .
go back to where you ’ re staying and go to sleep .
go .
now two things still need to be done .
i ’ ll put her on that .
yes , that ’ s the way i ’ ll do it .
i ’ ll pay you for your trouble .
are these wind instruments ?
yes , they are .
oh , there ’ s the problem .
what ’ s the problem ?
well , we ’ ll stop , then .
if you ’ ve got any music that can ’ t be heard , then play that .
but as i said , the general isn ’ t really in the mood to hear music now .
we don ’ t have any music that can ’ t be heard .
then pack up your instruments and go away .
go !
do you hear , my friend ?
please don ’ t play games .
cassio she ’ s awake , sir .
if she feels like coming over here , i ’ ll give her your message .
good to see you , iago .
you didn ’ t go to sleep , then ?
no .
i ’ m going to ask her to let me talk to desdemona .
i humbly thank you .
even for a good morning , lieutenant .
i ’ m sorry about what happened , but i ’ m sure everything will turn out all right .
the general and his wife are talking about it now , and she ’ s defending you strongly .
the moor says the man you hurt is very important in cyprus , and that under the circumstances he has no choice but to refuse to reinstate you .
but he says he still loves and respects you , and based on his own feelings alone he ’ s looking for an opportunity to safely take you back .
please find a way to give me some time alone with desdemona , if you think that ’ s all right .
please come in .
i ’ ll take you to a place where you can speak freely .
thank you very much .
iago , give these letters to the ship ’ s captain who brought me here , and ask him to pay my respects to the senate of venice .
now that ’ s done , i ’ m going to walk on the fortification walls .
i will , my lord .
shall we go see this fortification , men ?
we ’ re at your service , my lord .
i ’ ll do everything i can for you , cassio .
please do , madam .
i ’ m sure you and my husband will be as friendly as you were before .
yes , my lady .
but those political considerations might last such a long time that the general will forget my love and service , especially if i ’ m gone and someone else has my job .
my husband will never get a moment ’ s rest , i ’ ll keep him up at night talking about you until he runs out
but if you didn ’ t know about it , then you were wrong to get mad at us .
i ’ d never play pranks on you .
if she is , you can sue me for lying to you .
light the candles !
wake up my whole household !
i dreamt about this .
give me some light !
it ’ s time for me to say goodbye to you .
it would be inappropriate — dangerous , even — for me to be seen working against the moor , as i would if i stayed .
of patience .
i ’ m your advocate , and i ’ d rather die than give up on you .
madam , here comes your husband .
madam , i ’ d better leave now .
why not stay and hear me talk to him ?
no , madam .
i ’ m very uncomfortable , and that won ’ t help my case .
well , do whatever you think best .
hey !
i don ’ t like that .
what did you say ?
nothing , my lord , or if i did — i don ’ t know what .
wasn ’ t that cassio leaving my wife ?
cassio , my lord ?
i really think it was him .
what ’ s this , my lord ?
i was talking to a petitioner here just now , someone who ’ s suffering from your anger .
who do you mean ?
your lieutenant , cassio .
oh , if i ’ ve got any influence over you at all , please patch things up with him .
please call him and tell him to come back here .
was that him just now ?
my love , call him back in here .
not now , my sweet desdemona .
some other time .
but will it be soon ?
very soon , because you want it .
will it be tonight at supper ?
no , not tonight .
then tomorrow at dinner ?
well then , tomorrow night , or tuesday morning .
or tuesday noon or at night , or wednesday morning .
please just name a time , but don ’ t wait more than three days .
his mistake was hardly worth punishing him for in the first place — though in wartime it is sometimes necessary to make examples out of even the best soldiers .
so when should he come ?
tell me , othello .
i swear , i could do so much — please , no more .
i won ’ t refuse you anything .
this is like if i asked you to wear your gloves when it ’ s cold outside , or eat nutritious food , or do something that ’ s good for you .
if i ever have to ask you for something that will put your luck to the test , it ’ ll be something difficult and terrible .
i won ’ t deny you anything !
but in return , please , do one thing for me : leave me alone for a little while .
would i ever deny you anything ?
no .
goodbye , my husband .
goodbye , my desdemona .
i ’ ll come see you right away .
god help me , i love you !
my noble lord — what is it , iago ?
when you were wooing desdemona , did michael cassio know about it ?
yes , he knew about it the whole time .
why do you ask ?
why are you curious , iago ?
i didn ’ t realize he knew her .
oh , really ?
oh , really ?
yes , really .
do you see something wrong with that ?
isn ’ t he an honest man ?
honest , my lord ?
honest , yes , honest .
as far as i know , sir .
what are you thinking ?
thinking , my lord ?
thinking , my lord ? ” my god , you keep repeating everything i say as if you were thinking something too horrible to say out loud .
you ’ re thinking something .
just a minute ago i heard you say you didn ’ t like it when cassio left my wife .
what didn ’ t you like ?
and when i told you he was involved the whole time i was trying to get desdemona , you were like , “ oh , really ? ” and then you frowned and wrinkled up your forehead as if you were imagining something horrible .
if you ’ re my friend , tell me what you ’ re thinking .
my lord , you know i ’ m your friend .
i think you are .
as for michael cassio , i think it would be safe for me to swear that he ’ s honest .
i think so too .
if they ’ re not honest , they shouldn ’ t look like they are !
absolutely , people should be what they appear to be .
in that case , i think cassio ’ s an honest man .
no , i think there ’ s more to this than you ’ re letting on .
please tell me what you ’ re thinking — even your worst suspicions .
you want me to say what i ’ m thinking ?
you ’ re not being a good friend , iago , if you even please don ’ t ask me to tell you .
what are you talking about ?
a good reputation is the most valuable thing we have — men and women alike .
if you steal my money , you ’ re just stealing trash .
it ’ s something , it ’ s nothing : it ’ s yours , it ’ s mine , and it ’ ll belong to thousands more .
but if you steal my reputation , you ’ re robbing me of something that doesn ’ t make you richer , but makes me much poorer .
i ’ m going to find out what you ’ re thinking .
you can ’ t find that out , even if you held my heart in your hand you couldn ’ t make me tell you .
what ?
beware of jealousy , my lord !
it ’ s a green-eyed monster that makes fun of the victims it devours .
oh , what misery !
the person who ’ s poor and contented is rich enough .
god , help us not be jealous !
why are you telling me this ?
do you think i would live a life of jealousy , tormented by new suspicions every hour ?
no .
if there ’ s any doubt , there is no doubt .
if you say my wife is beautiful , eats well , loves good company , speaks freely , sings , plays music , and dances well , you ’ re not making me jealous .
when a woman is virtuous , talents like these just make her better .
so please listen to me .
i ’ m not talking about proof yet .
watch out !
i know the people of venice well .
they let god see things they wouldn ’ t show their husbands .
do you really think so ?
that ’ s right , she did .
well , there you go .
she was so young , but she deceived her father so thoroughly he thought it was witchcraft !
but i ’ m sorry i ’ ve blurted all this out .
i beg your pardon for loving you too much .
i ’ m indebted to you forever .
you seem a little depressed about this .
not at all , not at all .
really , i ’ m afraid you are .
i hope you remember that i said all this because i love you .
but i see you ’ re troubled .
please don ’ t take what i said more seriously than it deserves to be taken .
i won ’ t .
if you take it too seriously , it ’ ll have bad effects that i didn ’ t want it to have .
cassio ’ s a good friend of mine — my lord , i can see you ’ re upset .
no , not too upset .
goodbye , goodbye .
if you see anything else , let me know .
tell your wife to watch her .
leave me alone now , iago .
my lord , i ’ ll say goodbye now .
and affection , even if it ’ s just an act .
he and i will be there .
it ’ s true .
she ’ s gone .
the rest of my life will be nothing but bitterness .
do you think they ’ re married ?
yes , i really think so .
oh , heaven , how did she get out ?
my own flesh and blood rebels against me !
fathers , never trust your daughters just because they act obedient and innocent .
are there magic spells that can lead young virgins astray ?
have you ever heard of anything like that , roderigo ?
yes , sir , i have .
i think i can find him .
giving it back to him .
that will tell you a lot .
but in the meantime , just assume that i ’ m paranoid — as i ’ m pretty sure i am — and keep thinking she ’ s innocent , please .
don ’ t worry about how i handle it .
i ’ ll say goodbye once more .
this iago is extremely honest and good , and he knows a lot about human behavior .
if it turns out that she really is running around on me , i ’ ll send her away , even though it ’ ll break my heart .
oh what a curse marriage is !
i ’ d rather be a toad in a moldy basement than to have only a part of someone i love , sharing the rest of her with others .
this is the plague of important men — our wives betray us more than those of poor men .
it ’ s our destiny , like death .
we are destined to be betrayed when we are born .
oh , here she comes .
if she ’ s cheated on me , then heaven itself is a fake .
i don ’ t believe it .
what ’ s going on , othello , darling ?
the nobles of cyprus whom you invited to dinner are waiting for you .
i ’ m sorry .
why are you whispering ?
are you sick ?
i have a that ’ s from lack of sleep .
it ’ ll go away .
let me wrap up your head , and it will feel okay in less than an hour .
come on , i ’ ll escort you to dinner .
i ’ m very sorry you ’ re not feeling well .
hundred times .
but she loves it so much ( since othello told her she should always keep it with her ) that she always keeps it near her to kiss it and talk to it .
i ’ ll copy the embroidery pattern and then give it to iago .
heaven knows what he ’ s going to do with it .
what ’ s going on ?
what are you doing here alone ?
don ’ t snap at me .
i ’ ve got something for you .
you ’ ve got something for me ?
it ’ s a common what ?
to have a stupid wife .
oh , is that so ?
and what would you give me for the handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
what handkerchief ?
the one the moor gave to desdemona , which you asked me to steal so many times .
you stole it from her ?
she dropped it carelessly , and , seizing the opportunity , since i was here , i picked it up .
look , here it is .
good girl , give it to me .
and what are you going to do with it ?
what ’ s it to you ?
if you don ’ t need it for some important reason , then give it back to me .
poor lady , she ’ ll go crazy when she sees it ’ s missing .
now go , leave me .
the moor ’ s mind has already become infected with my poisonous suggestions .
here he comes .
no drugs or sleeping pills will ever give you the restful sleep that you had last night .
she ’ s cheating on me ?
it is better to be tricked completely than to only suspect a little .
what ’ s with you , my lord ?
i had no idea she was cheating on me .
i never saw it or suspected it , so it never hurt me .
i slept well , ate well , and was happy .
i never saw cassio ’ s kisses on her lips .
a man who ’ s robbed , but doesn ’ t miss what ’ s stolen , isn ’ t robbed at all .
i ’ m sorry to hear this .
i would ’ ve been happy if the whole army had had sex with her , the lowest-ranking grunts and all , as long as i didn ’ t know anything about it .
oh , goodbye to my peace of mind !
goodbye to my happiness !
goodbye to the soldiers and to the wars that make men great !
goodbye !
goodbye to the horses and the trumpets and the drums , the flute and the splendid banners , and all those proud displays and pageantry of war !
and you deadly cannons that roar like thunderbolts thrown by the gods , goodbye !
othello ’ s career is over .
is this possible , my lord ?
has it come to this ?
show me , or at least prove it beyond the shadow of a doubt .
oh , heaven help me !
aren ’ t you a rational human being ?
don ’ t you have any sense at all ?
goodbye .
what a horrible world we live in !
it ’ s not safe to be straightforward and honest .
no , stop .
you should always be honest .
i should always be wise .
i swear , i think my wife ’ s faithful , and i think she ’ s not .
i think you ’ re trustworthy one minute and then not the next .
i need proof !
her reputation was as pure as the snow , but now it ’ s as dirty and black as my own face .
as long as there are
i see you ’ re all eaten up with emotion .
i ’ m sorry i said anything .
you want proof ?
want ?
yes , i want it , and i ’ ll get it .
but how ?
how will you get proof ?
are you going to hide and watch them having sex ?
death and damnation !
oh !
i think it would be very hard to arrange for them to have sex while you watched .
what can i say ?
what proof is there ?
it ’ d be impossible for you to watch them , even if they were as horny as animals in heat and as stupid as drunks .
but if you would be willing to accept circumstantial evidence as proof , we can get that .
give me one good reason to think she ’ s cheating on me .
i don ’ t like what you ’ re asking me to do .
but since i ’ ve gotten myself involved this far , because i ’ m so stupidly honest and because i like you so much , i ’ ll keep going .
i recently shared a bed with cassio , and i couldn ’ t sleep because of a raging toothache .
monstrous !
no , it was just a dream .
it ’ s a reason for suspicion , even though it ’ s just a dream .
and it might back up other evidence that may seem too flimsy .
i ’ ll tear her to pieces !
just tell me this : have you ever seen her holding a handkerchief with an embroidered strawberry pattern on it ?
if it ’ s the same one — if it ’ s the same one , or any one that belongs to her , then together with the other evidence it ’ s pretty strong .
oh , i ’ d kill that bastard cassio forty thousand times if i could !
killing him once is not enough revenge .
now i see it ’ s true .
my heart feels like it ’ s full of poisonous snakes !
be patient , i ’ m telling you .
you may change your mind later .
never , iago .
i swear to god i ’ ll get revenge .
don ’ t get up yet .
let heaven be my witness — i ’ m putting my mind , my heart , and my hands in othello ’ s control .
let him command me , and i ’ ll do whatever he asks , no matter how violent .
i accept your devotion with my deepest love .
within the next three days i want to hear you tell me that cassio ’ s dead .
but let her live .
oh , damn her , damn her !
come away with me .
i ’ m going inside to think up some way to kill that beautiful devil .
you ’ re my lieutenant now .
i ’ m yours forever .
lead the way .
i ’ ll stop at every house .
i ’ ll reward you for your troubles .
why do you say that ?
oh , come on .
where does he sleep ?
telling you where he ’ s sleeping is like telling you where i ’ m lying .
what on earth does that mean ?
i don ’ t know where he ’ s staying , so if i told you he ’ s sleeping here or there , i ’ d be lying .
can you ask around and find out ?
find him and tell him to come here .
tell him i ’ ve spoken to my husband on his behalf , and i think everything will be all right .
i think i can do that .
where could i have lost that handkerchief , emilia ?
i don ’ t know , madam .
believe me , i ’ d rather have lost a purse full of gold coins .
this would be enough to make my husband suspect me , if he wasn ’ t so free of jealousy .
he ’ s not jealous ?
who , him ?
i think all tendencies to jealousy were burned out of him by the sun of his native land .
look , here he comes .
i won ’ t leave him alone until he gives cassio his job back . — how are you , my lord ?
hot , hot and moist .
with a hand like this you need to
fast and pray to stave off temptations .
it ’ s a nice hand , an open one .
but these days , people give each other their hands without their hearts .
i don ’ t know about that .
now , don ’ t forget , you promised me something .
what did i promise , my dear ?
i sent for cassio to come talk with you .
i have a bad cold that ’ s bothering me .
lend me your handkerchief .
here , my lord .
no , the one i gave you .
i don ’ t have it with me .
you don ’ t ?
no , my lord .
that ’ s not good .
almost read people ’ s thoughts .
when she was dying she gave it to me and told me to give it to my wife when i got married .
i did .
is that possible ?
yes , it ’ s true .
there ’ s magic in its fabric .
a two-hundred-year-old witch sewed it while she was in a fevered trance .
the silk came from sacred silkworms , and it was dyed with fluid made from embalmed virgins ' hearts .
really ?
is that true ?
it ’ s absolutely true , so take good care of it .
i wish i had never seen it !
ha !
why ?
why are you yelling at me so angrily ?
is it lost ?
is it gone ?
tell me , is it missing ?
god help me !
what do you have to say for yourself ?
it ’ s not lost , but what if it were ?
what do you mean ?
i ’ m telling you , it ’ s not lost .
please hire cassio again .
bring me the handkerchief — my mind is full of doubt .
come on .
the handkerchief !
damn it !
and you say he ’ s not jealous ?
i never saw him like this before .
they ’ re like stomachs and we ’ re just the food .
they eat us up hungrily , and when they ’ re full , they vomit us up .
look , here comes cassio and my husband .
there ’ s no other way .
she ’ s the one who ’ s got to do it .
go ahead and ask her .
then i could stop wondering , and find some other career .
if his face changed as much as his personality has , i wouldn ’ t recognize him .
god knows i have done my best to argue for you , and made him angry at me for being so aggressive .
you ’ ll just have to be patient for a little while .
i ’ ll do what i can , more than i ’ d do for myself .
let that be enough for you .
is othello angry ?
can he even get angry ?
if he ’ s angry , there must be something seriously wrong .
please , do so .
there must be some political news from venice , or some dangerous plot here in cyprus has ruined his good mood .
that ’ s the way it goes .
we shouldn ’ t expect men to be perfect , or for them to be as polite as on the weddingday .
i hope to god it ’ s something political , like you think , and not jealousy involving you .
oh no !
i never gave him reason to be jealous .
but jealous people don ’ t think like that .
they ’ re never jealous for a reason ; they ’ re just jealous .
it ’ s like a monster that just grows and grows , out of nothing .
i hope god keeps that monster from growing in othello ’ s mind !
amen to that , lady .
i ’ ll go look for him — cassio , stay around here .
if he ’ s in a good mood i ’ ll mention you again , and do everything i can .
i thank you , lady .
hello , cassio !
why are you so far from home ?
how are you , my pretty bianca ?
to tell you the truth , i was just going to your house .
and i was just going to yours .
you ’ ve kept away from me for a week ?
seven days and seven nights ?
a hundred and sixty-eight hours ?
and lovers ' hours are a hundred and sixty times longer than normal ones !
what a tedious wait !
oh , cassio , where did you get this ?
has it come to this ?
well , well .
oh , come on , woman .
well , whose is it ?
it ’ s pretty .
so i ’ d like it copied .
take it and do that for me , and leave me alone for a while .
leave you alone !
why ?
i ’ m waiting here for the general , and i don ’ t want him to see me with a woman .
and why ’ s that ?
it ’ s not because i don ’ t love you .
but you don ’ t love me .
please , just walk with me a little ways , and tell me if i ’ ll see you later tonight .
i can only walk a little way with you , since i ’ m waiting here .
but i ’ ll see you soon .
all right , have it your way .
i have to make do .
nine or ten times i wanted to stab him under the ribs .
it ’ s better that you didn ’ t kill him .
but he kept chattering so foolishly , talking about you in such insulting and despicable terms , that it was hard for me to restrain myself .
but please tell me , sir , is your marriage let him do his worst .
the services i have done for the venetian government will count for more than his complaints will .
do you really think so ?
what do you mean , do i think so ?
what , just because they kissed in private ?
an illicit kiss !
maybe she was just naked in bed with him for an hour or so , but they didn ’ t do anything .
naked in bed together , but without doing anything ?
come on , iago .
as long as they didn ’ t do anything , it would only be a minor sin .
but if i gave my wife a handkerchief — then what ?
her reputation is also her own .
can she give that away too ?
but a handkerchief — god , i wish i could forget about the handkerchief !
what you told me it haunts me like a nightmare — he ’ s got my handkerchief !
yes , what about it ?
that ’ s not good .
what if i ’ d said i saw him do something to hurt you ?
yes , but he ’ d deny it all .
what did he say ?
he said he did — i don ’ t know .
he was in bed with — with her ?
with her , on top of her — however you want to say it .
in bed with her ?
on top of her ?
my god , it ’ s nauseating !
handkerchief — confessions — handkerchief !
noses , ears , lips .
is it possible ?
this is the way to trick gullible fools .
hey , cassio !
what ’ s the matter ?
this is his second fit like this .
he had one yesterday .
rub his temples .
no , don ’ t .
if you interrupt it , he ’ ll foam at the mouth and go crazy .
look , he ’ s moving .
why don ’ t you go away for a bit ?
when he leaves , it ’ s very important that i talk to you .
what happened , general ?
did you hit your head ?
are you making fun of me ?
i wish you could face your bad news like a man !
he ’ s subhuman , like an animal .
did he confess ?
sir , be a man .
your case is better than that .
then i ’ ll know exactly what she is , just as i know what i am .
you ’ re wise !
that ’ s for sure .
while you were dazed by grief — which isn ’ t appropriate for a man like you — cassio showed up here .
i got him to leave , and made up an excuse for your trance .
i told him to come back and talk to me in a bit , and he promised he would .
i ’ ll make him tell me the whole story again — where , how often , how long ago — and when he plans to sleep with your wife in the future .
i ’ m telling you , just watch his face .
but stay calm , and don ’ t get carried away by rage , or i ’ ll think you ’ re not a man .
do you hear what i ’ m saying , iago ?
will you go hide ?
now i ’ ll ask cassio about bianca , a prostitute who sells her body for food and clothes .
that ’ s the whore ’ s curse , to seduce many men , but to be seduced by one .
whenever he talks about her he can ’ t stop laughing .
and when he laughs , othello will go crazy .
in his ignorant jealousy , he ’ ll totally misunderstand cassio ’ s smiles , gestures , and jokes . — how are you , lieutenant ?
the poor thing !
he ’ s laughing already !
i never knew a woman who loved a man so much .
the poor thing , i really think she loves me .
now he denies it a bit , and tries to laugh it off .
have you heard this , cassio ?
he ’ s asking him to tell the story again .
go on , tell it .
she says you ’ re going to marry her .
are you ?
ha , ha , ha !
do you think you ’ ve won ?
me , marry her ?
that whore ?
please give me a little credit !
i ’ m not that stupid .
ha , ha , ha !
so , so , so , so !
you ’ re kidding !
all right , then .
she thinks i ’ ll marry her because she loves me .
iago is gesturing for me to come closer .
now he ’ s telling the story .
she was here just now .
she hangs around me all the time .
i was talking to some venetians down by the shore , and the fool showed up .
ha , ha , ha !
now he ’ s saying how she took him into our bedroom .
look out , here she comes .
damn you !
what did you mean by giving me this handkerchief ?
i was an idiot to take it !
you want me to copy the embroidery pattern ?
that was a likely story , that you found it in your room and didn ’ t know who it belonged to .
this is a love token from some other slut , and you want me to copy its pattern for you ?
what is it , my dear bianca ?
what ’ s wrong ?
my god , that ’ s my handkerchief !
if you want to come have dinner with me , you can .
if you don ’ t want to , then good riddance .
go after her , go .
actually , i should .
will you be having dinner with her tonight ?
yes , i will .
did you see how he laughed about sleeping with her ?
oh iago !
and did you see the handkerchief ?
was it mine ?
it was yours , i swear .
and do you see how much your foolish wife means to him ?
she gave it to him , and he gave it to his whore .
i wish i could keep killing him for nine years straight .
oh , she ’ s a fine woman !
a fair woman !
a sweet woman !
no , you have to forget all that now .
yes , let her die and rot and go to hell tonight .
oh , the world never saw a sweeter creature .
but that ’ s not how you ’ re going to be .
she ’ s so good at sewing , and a wonderful musician .
oh , she could sing a wild bear to sleep !
oh , she ’ s so witty and creative !
all the worse that she stooped this low , then .
oh , a thousand times worse , a thousand times — and what a sweet personality she has !
yes , a little too sweet .
yes , that ’ s for sure .
oh , it ’ s dreadful , dreadful , iago !
if you still feel so affectionate toward her , then why not give her permission to cheat on you ?
i ’ ll chop her into pieces .
oh , it ’ s horrible of her .
that ’ s worse .
get me some poison tonight , iago .
i won ’ t argue with her , so her beautiful body won ’ t disarm me . — tonight , iago .
don ’ t do it with poison .
strangle her in her bed , the same bed she ’ s contaminated .
good , good , i like that — it ’ s only fair !
very good !
and let me kill cassio .
you ’ ll hear more from me by midnight .
excellent , good .
that ’ s her father and his friends , who ’ ve been roused out of bed .
you ’ d better go inside .
no , i must let them find me .
my good qualities , my legal status as desdemona ’ s husband , and my innocence will protect me .
is it them ?
i don ’ t think so .
the servants of the duke and my lieutenant ?
hello , everyone !
what ’ s going on ?
he needs to see you right away .
what do you think he wants ?
something about cyprus .
i think it ’ s important .
the warships have sent a dozen messages tonight , one after the other , and many of the senators have been awakened and are at the duke ’ s already .
they ’ re very anxious for you to get there .
when you weren ’ t at home , the senate sent out three different search parties to find you .
it ’ s good you found me .
i ’ ll just speak a word or two here in the house and then i ’ ll go with you .
what ’ s that trumpet for ?
i think someone ’ s coming from venice .
look , your wife is with him .
greetings , good general !
the duke and senators of venice greet you .
what ’ s new , cousin lodovico ?
very nice to see you , sir .
welcome to cyprus .
thank you .
how is lieutenant cassio ?
well , he ’ s alive .
are you sure of that ?
excuse me ?
he didn ’ t say anything , he ’ s reading .
so there ’ s a rift between othello and cassio ?
yes , unfortunately .
i ’ d do anything to bring them back together , since i really care for cassio .
damn it all !
excuse me , my lord ?
are you in your right mind ?
is he angry ?
i think they want him to go home and appoint cassio governor in his place .
i ’ m happy about that .
oh , are you really !
my lord ?
i ’ m glad you ’ re insane enough to admit it in front of me .
why , sweet othello — i haven ’ t done anything to deserve this !
my lord , no one will believe this in venice , even though i ’ d swear i saw it with my own eyes .
that was too much .
she ’ s crying .
oh , you devil , you devil !
get out of my sight !
i wouldn ’ t want to stay here and make you angry .
she ’ s obedient — a fine lady .
please , my lord , call her back .
madam !
my lord ?
what do you want with her , sir ?
who , me ?
see how well she can turn ?
she can turn and turn , and then turn on you again .
and she can cry , sir — oh , how she can cry !
cassio can have my job .
and tonight , sir , i invite you have dinner with me .
welcome to cyprus .
horny animals !
is this the same moor whom the senate considers so capable ?
he ’ s changed a great deal .
is he sane ?
is he losing his mind ?
he is what he is .
i won ’ t say anything negative about what he might be .
if he isn ’ t what he might be , then i wish to god he were !
hitting his wife ?
it ’ s true , that wasn ’ t such a nice thing to do .
but i wish i could say that ’ s the last time he ’ ll do it !
is it a habit of his ?
or did the letter make him emotional somehow , and this is the first time he ’ s done it ?
oh , it ’ s too bad !
it wouldn ’ t be right for me to tell you everything i ’ ve seen and heard .
just go after him and watch what he does next .
i ’ m sorry i was so wrong about him .
you haven ’ t seen anything , then ?
no , and i didn ’ t hear anything either , or suspect anything at all .
but you ’ ve seen her and cassio together .
yes , but i didn ’ t see anything wrong , and i heard every syllable they said .
didn ’ t they ever whisper ?
never , my lord .
or ask you to leave the room ?
never .
not even to get her fan , or her gloves , or her mask , or anything ?
no , my lord .
that ’ s strange .
i ’ d swear to you on my soul that she ’ s a good , honest person , sir .
tell her to come here .
go .
she says all the right things , but the dumbest brothel-keeper would tell the same story .
i ’ ve seen her do it .
my lord , what do you want ?
please , dear , come here .
what can i do for you ?
let me see your eyes .
look at my face .
what horrible thing are you imagining ?
i can tell you ’ re furious , but i don ’ t understand what you ’ re saying .
go ahead , swear to that , so you ’ ll be damned to hell for lying .
heaven knows i am .
heaven knows you ’ re as unfaithful as hell .
unfaithful , my lord ?
with whom ?
how am i unfaithful ?
leave me alone , desdemona , go away !
because of me ?
if you ’ ve been ordered back to venice because of my father , don ’ t blame me .
you may have lost his respect , but so have i.
even that i could put up with .
be like the fountain that my children and all my descendants flow from , has rejected me !
worse than that , she ’ s polluted herself , so that the fountain is a place where disgusting toads copulate and reproduce !
even the goddess of patience couldn ’ t look at this and be patient — it ’ s too horrifying !
i hope you think i ’ m faithful to you .
as faithful as flies in rotting meat , which give birth to maggots every time the wind blows .
oh , i wish you ’ d never been born !
have i done something to offend you without knowing it ?
was someone as beautiful as you meant to be a whore ?
what have you done ?
what have you done ?
oh , you streetwalker !
what have you done ?
you brazen whore !
i swear to god you ’ re accusing me wrongly !
so you ’ re saying you ’ re not a whore ?
no , i ’ m as honest as i am christian .
what , you ’ re not a whore ?
no , i swear it .
is that possible ?
oh , heaven help us !
i mistook you for that sly venetian woman who married othello . — you whorehouse-keeper .
you !
we ’ ve finished our business .
here ’ s some money for you .
please lock the door and keep quiet .
what ’ s he talking about ?
how are you , madam ?
ensign , what ’ s he doing in there ?
tonight he boarded a treasure ship .
if he can keep it , he ’ ll be set forever .
i don ’ t understand .
he ’ s married .
to whom ?
here comes another group looking for you .
it ’ s brabantio .
he intends to do something bad to you .
hey !
stop right there !
sir , it ’ s the moor .
get him , he ’ s a thief !
with who ?
i don ’ t have a lord .
don ’ t talk to me , emilia .
things have certainly changed !
it ’ s fair for him to treat me like this , very fair .
what have i ever done that he has anything to complain about ?
what can i do for you , madam ?
how are you ?
i don ’ t know .
when grown-ups teach little children , they do it gently and easily .
he might have treated me like that , because i ’ m as unused to abuse as a little child .
what ’ s the matter , lady ?
he called her a whore so many times , and heaped up so much abuse on her that good people can ’ t stand to hear it .
am i that name , iago ?
what name , madam ?
what my lord said i was .
why did he do that ?
i don ’ t know .
i just know i ’ m not one .
don ’ t cry , don ’ t cry .
what a day this is !
did she give up all those chances to marry noblemen , give up her father and country and friends , just to be called a whore ?
doesn ’ t that make you want to cry ?
it ’ s just my bad luck .
damn him !
how did he get such an idea ?
heaven knows .
i bet my life some evil busybody , some meddling , lying jerk made up this rumor to get some position .
i bet my life on it .
nobody ’ s that bad .
it ’ s impossible .
if there is , then heaven help him !
why should he call her a whore ?
who ’ s been with her ?
the moor is being tricked by some crook , some terrible villain , some rotten bastard .
oh , i wish we could unmask scoundrels like that , and give a whip to every good man to beat them senseless with !
keep your voice down .
oh , to hell with those people !
it ’ s the same kind of guy who got you upset and made you suspect i ’ d cheated on you with the moor .
you ’ re a fool .
shut up .
oh god , iago , what can i do to win my husband back again ?
please go to him , my friend .
i swear i have no idea why he stopped loving me .
then i hope i have a life of misery !
unkindness is powerful , and his unkindness may kill me , but it ’ ll never destroy my love .
i can ’ t say “ whore . ” it makes me sick to say the word even now .
political business is bothering him , and he ’ s just taking it out on you .
if only that were all it is — it is , i promise .
those trumpets are calling us in to dinner .
the venetians are waiting for their food .
go in , and don ’ t cry .
everything will be all right .
how are you , roderigo ?
i don ’ t think you ’ re treating me fairly .
what makes you say that ?
well , i won ’ t take it any longer .
will you listen to me , roderigo ?
your words and actions don ’ t match up .
that ’ s not fair .
it ’ s the truth .
the jewels you took from me to deliver to desdemona would ’ ve made even a nun want to sleep with me .
you told me she got them , and that she promised to give me a little something in return soon , but nothing like that ever happens .
well , all right then .
fine .
fine ! ” he says .
all right ! ” it ’ s not fine , and i ’ m not all right !
it ’ s wrong , and i ’ m starting to realize i ’ m being cheated !
okay .
it ’ s not okay !
i ’ m going to tell desdemona my feelings .
if she returns my jewels , i ’ ll stop pursuing her and apologize to her .
if not , i ’ ll challenge you to a duel .
you ’ ve said what you have to say now .
yes , and i ’ ll do everything i just said .
from this moment on i have a higher opinion of you than before .
give me your hand , roderigo .
your complaint against me is perfectly understandable , but i still insist i ’ ve done everything i could to help you .
it doesn ’ t look that way to me .
i admit it doesn ’ t look that way to me , and the fact that you suspect me shows that you ’ re smart .
but roderigo , if you ’ re as courageous and determined as i think you are , then wait just a bit longer .
if you ’ re not having sex with desdemona tomorrow night , then i suggest you find some way to stab me in the back and kill me .
well , what ’ s your plan ?
is it feasible ?
venice has made cassio governor here on cyprus .
is that true ?
then desdemona and othello will go back to venice .
what do you mean , get rid of him ?
i mean knock his brains out , so he can ’ t take othello ’ s place .
and that ’ s what you want me to do !
yes , if you want to help yourself .
he ’ s having dinner tonight with a prostitute , and i ’ ll go visit him .
he doesn ’ t know he ’ s been appointed governor yet .
when you see him walking by here ( as i ’ ll make sure he does between twelve and one ) you can nab him .
i ’ ll be nearby to help you , and between the two of us we can handle him .
i ’ ll give you such reasons for killing him that you ’ ll feel obliged to snuff him out .
it ’ s nearly dinner time , and the night ’ s going to be wasted .
let ’ s go !
i want to hear more about this .
you will .
please , sir , don ’ t trouble yourself .
good night , madam .
thank you .
you ’ re most welcome .
would you walk out with me , sir ? — oh , desdemona — yes , my lord ?
go to bed right this minute .
i ’ ll be there shortly .
i will , my lord .
how are things now ?
he looks calmer than he did before .
send me away ?
that ’ s what he said .
so give me my nightgown , emilia , and i ’ ll say goodnight .
we shouldn ’ t displease him .
yes .
i wish you ’ d never met him .
that ’ s not what i wish .
i love him even when he ’ s harsh and mean — help me unpin this , would you ? — i love even his stubbornness , his frowns , his bad moods .
i put those wedding sheets on your bed , as you asked .
it doesn ’ t matter .
oh , how silly we are !
if i die before you do make sure i ’ m wrapped in those sheets in my coffin .
listen to you !
don ’ t be silly !
she knew an old song called “ willow ” that reminded her of her own story , and she died singing it .
i can ’ t get that song out of my head tonight .
it ’ s all i can do to keep myself from hanging my head down in despair and singing it like poor barbary .
please , hurry up .
should i get your nightgown ?
no , just help me unpin this .
that lodovico is a good-looking man .
he ’ s very handsome .
he speaks well .
i know a lady in venice who ’ d walk all the way to palestine for a kiss from him .
it ’ s the wind .
my eyes itch — is that an omen i ’ ll be crying soon ?
no , it doesn ’ t mean anything .
i heard someone say that ’ s what it means .
oh , these men , these men !
do you honestly think — tell me , emilia — there are women who ’ d cheat on their husbands in such a disgusting manner ?
there are women like that out there , no question .
you , roderigo !
come on , i ’ ll fight you .
sir , your age and status inspire more respect than your weapons do .
you evil thief , where have you hidden my daughter ?
you devil , you ’ ve put a spell on her !
it ’ s obvious to everyone that you ’ ve tricked her , drugged her , or kidnapped her .
if he struggles , use force !
where do you want me to go to respond to these charges ?
would you ever do such a thing for all the world ?
why , wouldn ’ t you ?
by the light of heaven , no , i would not !
i wouldn ’ t either , by daylight .
it would be easier to do it in the dark .
could you really do such a thing , for all the world ?
the world ’ s huge .
it ’ s a big prize for such a small sin .
i don ’ t think you would .
actually i think i would , and then i ’ d undo it after i did it .
i wouldn ’ t do it for a nice ring , or fine linen , or pretty gowns or petticoats or hats .
but for the whole world ?
who wouldn ’ t cheat on her husband to make him king ?
i ’ d risk my soul for that .
i ’ d never do such a bad thing , not for the whole world !
why , a bad action is just a wrong in this world , but when you ’ ve won the whole world , it ’ s a wrong in your own world , so you can make it right then .
i don ’ t think any woman like that exists .
yes , a dozen of them — as many as there are women in the world , in fact .
but i do think it ’ s the husband ’ s fault if we wives cheat on them .
for instance , our husbands
we have feelings .
husbands need to know that their wives are human beings too .
they see , smell , and taste sweet and sour just like their husbands .
i think they do .
is it out of lust ?
i think so .
is it a weakness ?
it is .
and don ’ t we have passions , and a taste for fun , and weaknesses , just like men ?
then tell them to treat us well .
good night , good night .
i pray that god will let me learn from women like that — not to follow their bad example , but to avoid it !
here , stand behind this wall ; he ’ ll come right away .
quick , quick .
don ’ t be afraid .
i ’ ll be right next to you .
this will either make us or break us .
i ’ m right behind you .
be bold , and get ready .
i don ’ t really want to do this , but he ’ s given me good reasons .
i guess it ’ s only one man — no big deal .
i know the sound of his walk . — die , villain !
oh , i ’ m dead !
i ’ ll be crippled forever !
help !
murder !
murder !
that ’ s cassio ’ s voice .
iago has kept his word .
oh , what a villain i am !
that ’ s the truth .
help me !
get some light !
get me a surgeon !
it ’ s him !
brave iago , how honest and trustworthy you are !
you teach me how i should act .
whore , your lover ’ s dead now , and you ’ ll be going to hell soon .
i ’ m coming , slut !
i ’ ve shut the memory of your beautiful eyes out of my heart .
you ’ ve already stained our sheets with your lust ; now i ’ ll stain them with your whore ’ s blood .
help !
isn ’ t there a guard around ?
no one passing by ?
murder !
murder !
something ’ s wrong , the man sounds panicked .
oh , help !
listen !
i ’ ve acted like such a villain !
two or three men are groaning .
but it ’ s dark out , and it could be a trap .
it ’ s not safe to go near them till we get more help .
nobody ’ s coming ?
i ’ ll bleed to death .
look !
here ’ s someone coming in his pajamas , with a candle and weapons .
who ’ s there ?
who ’ s shouting “ murder ” ?
we don ’ t know .
didn ’ t you hear someone shouting ?
i ’ m here , here !
for heaven ’ s sake , help me !
he ’ s a good man .
is that you , iago ?
i ’ m here , i ’ ve been destroyed by villains !
help me .
oh , lieutenant !
what villains did this to you ?
i think one of them is nearby and can ’ t get away .
that ’ s one of them .
damned iago !
you inhuman dog !
killing men in the dark ?
where are these murderers ?
are you good or evil ?
judge for yourself .
signor lodovico ?
that ’ s me .
i beg your pardon .
cassio ’ s been wounded .
cassio !
how are you doing , brother ?
my leg ’ s been cut in two .
god forbid !
bring me some light , gentlemen , i ’ ll bind the wound with my shirt .
what ’ s the matter ?
who ’ s shouting ?
who ’ s shouting ?
oh , my dear cassio !
my sweet cassio !
oh , cassio , cassio , cassio !
you notorious whore !
cassio , do you know who might have stabbed you like this ?
no .
i ’ m sorry to find you like this .
i ’ ve been looking all over for you .
he ’ s fainted !
oh cassio , cassio , cassio !
sir , i believe this piece of trash , bianca , has something to do with all this trouble . — hang in there , cassio . — come here , bring the light .
do you recognize this face ?
that ’ s the one , sir .
do you know him ?
know him ?
yes .
i ’ m glad to see you .
how are you doing , cassio ? — someone bring me a stretcher !
roderigo !
it ’ s him , it ’ s him .
good — here ’ s the stretcher .
get somebody strong to carry him out of here .
i ’ ll get the general ’ s surgeon .
there wasn ’ t any problem .
i don ’ t even know him .
keep an eye on her .
do you see ?
the guilty speak volumes even when they ’ re silent .
what ’ s the matter ?
what ’ s the matter , husband ?
cassio was attacked here in the dark by roderigo and men who escaped .
he ’ s near death , and roderigo ’ s dead already .
oh , no , good gentleman !
oh no , good cassio !
this is what happens when you visit whores .
please , emilia , ask cassio where he was at dinner tonight . —
he ate at my house , but that doesn ’ t make me nervous .
oh , did he ?
i order you to come with me .
go to hell , you whore !
as moral as me !
damn you !
gentlemen , let ’ s go make sure cassio ’ s wounds are properly dressed . — come on , ma 'am , you can tell us another story .
emilia , go to the castle and tell othello and desdemona what happened . — will you please go now ?
to prison , until you ’ re called into court .
his messengers are waiting here to take me to him immediately , on pressing state business .
it ’ s true .
the duke ’ s in a meeting right now , and he ’ s sent for you too .
the duke ’ s in a meeting ?
at this time of night ?
bring him with us .
the law ’ s on my side .
the duke and any of my fellow senators will take this wrong as seriously as if it were their own .
if we let crimes like this happen , slaves and heathens will be our rulers .
i have to do it , i have to do it .
but i won ’ t shed any of her blood or scar that beautiful skin , whiter than snow and smooth as the finest marble .
but she ’ s got to die , or she ’ ll cheat on other men .
put out the light of the candle , and then put out the light of her heart .
if i extinguish the candle , i can light it again if i regret it .
when i ’ ve plucked this rose , i can ’ t make it grow again ; it will have no choice but to wither and die .
who ’ s there ?
othello ?
yes , desdemona .
will you come to bed , my lord ?
yes , my lord .
oh , my lord , what do you mean by that ?
be quick about it .
i ’ ll wait over here .
i don ’ t want to kill you before you ’ ve readied your soul .
no , i don ’ t want to send your soul to hell when i kill you .
you ’ re talking about killing ?
yes , i am .
then heaven have mercy on me .
amen to that , from the bottom of my heart .
if you really feel that way , then i hope you won ’ t kill me .
hmmph !
i don ’ t know why i should be afraid , since i haven ’ t done anything wrong .
but i ’ m still afraid .
think of your sins .
my only sin was loving you too much .
yes , that ’ s why you have to die .
you ’ re wrong to kill me for loving you .
why are you chewing on your lower lip like that ?
you ’ re shaking with emotion .
these are bad omens , but i hope , i hope , they don ’ t predict my future .
i will .
what ’ s this all about ?
you gave that handkerchief , the one i loved and gave to you , to cassio .
no , i swear by my life and soul !
bring him here and ask him .
you ’ re on your deathbed .
but i ’ m not dying yet !
yes , right now .
so confess your sin freely now .
you ’ re going to die .
then heaven have mercy on me !
amen to that .
and you have mercy on me too !
i never gave him any token of romantic love .
i saw him holding the handkerchief !
you liar , you ’ re turning my heart to stone , and making me call what i ’ ll do murder , when i had been thinking of it as a sacrifice !
i saw the handkerchief .
he ’ s already done so .
what , my lord ?
that he had sex with you .
what ?
yes .
he wouldn ’ t say that .
no .
honest iago ’ s arranged that .
what , is he dead ?
if he had as many lives as he ’ s got hairs on his head , i would ’ ve killed them all in revenge .
oh , he ’ s been betrayed , and i ’ ve been ruined .
send me away , my lord , but don ’ t kill me !
kill me tomorrow — but let me live tonight .
no , if you struggle with me — just half an hour !
just let me say one prayer !
it ’ s too late .
what ’ s that noise ?
aren ’ t you dead yet ?
who ’ s there ?
yes , it ’ s emilia .
what ’ s the matter with you now ?
yes , just now , my lord .
cassio ’ s killed a young venetian named roderigo .
roderigo ’ s been killed ?
and cassio ’ s killed ?
no , cassio wasn ’ t killed .
cassio ’ s not dead ?
then the wrong man is dead , and sweet revenge has gone wrong .
oh , i ’ ve been murdered unfairly !
oh lord , who ’ s that crying ?
that ?
what ?
oh , no , that was my lady ’ s voice .
help !
help !
oh , lady , speak again .
sweet desdemona !
oh sweet mistress , speak !
i ’ m dying an innocent woman .
oh , who did this thing ?
no one .
i did it myself .
give my love to my kind husband .
oh , goodbye !
why , how could she have been murdered ?
my god , who knows ?
you heard her say it wasn ’ t me .
yes , she said that .
i must go report what happened .
she was lying even as she was going down to hell .
i did kill her .
then she was even more an angel , and you ’ re an even blacker devil !
she cheated on me , and she was a whore .
you slander her , you devil .
she was fickle and unfaithful , like water .
she was utterly true to you !
ask your husband if you doubt me .
if i didn ’ t have a good reason to do this , damn me to the very bottom of hell .
your husband knew about everything .
my husband !
your husband .
he said she was unfaithful ?
yes , with cassio .
if she ’ d been faithful to me , i never would have given her up , not even if god himself offered me a jewel as big as a planet in exchange for her .
my husband .
yes , he ’ s the one who first told me about her .
he ’ s an honest man who detests evil actions .
my husband ?
why do you keep repeating that , woman ?
i ’ m telling you , your husband .
oh , my mistress , a villain has made a mockery of your love !
my husband said she was unfaithful !
yes , him , woman .
i said “ your husband . ” — do you understand that word ?
my friend , your husband , the honest , honest iago .
if he said that , then i hope his malicious soul rots in hell forever .
he ’ s lying through his teeth !
she was too attached to her filthy marriage ever to do a thing like that !
ha !
go ahead , do your worst .
you weren ’ t good enough for her .
you ’ d better shut up !
oh , you idiot !
you stupid fool !
as dumb as dirt !
i ’ ll tell everyone what you did , even if it
the moor ’ s killed my mistress !
murder , murder !
what ’ s the matter ?
what ’ s going on here , general ?
oh , are you here , iago ?
you ’ ve done a good job , that other men can attribute their murders to you !
what ’ s the matter ?
i told him what i thought .
but did you tell him she cheated on him ?
i did .
then you told a lie , a sick , wicked lie .
i swear on my soul it was a lie .
you said she slept with cassio .
did you say cassio ?
yes , with cassio .
now be quiet .
my mistress here lies murdered in her bed — no , heaven forbid !
you can ’ t trust them .
it ’ s true , they ’ re inconsistent .
my letters say there are a hundred and seven ships .
and mine say a hundred and forty .
and mine say two hundred .
but often in these cases , reports are just estimates .
yes , we get the idea .
it ’ s a messenger from the warships .
and your lies caused this murder .
i ’ ll kill myself out of grief !
oh , evil , evil !
are you crazy ?
i ’ m ordering you , go home .
good gentlemen , give me permission to speak .
i know i ought to obey my husband , but not now .
maybe i ’ ll never go home again , iago !
oh !
oh !
oh !
yes , go ahead and moan , because you killed the sweetest , most innocent woman who ever lived !
she was filthy !
i ’ m glad your father isn ’ t alive to see this .
him terribly .
it would make him curse the heavens and be damned to hell .
it ’ s sad , but iago knows she had sex with cassio a thousand times .
damn it , shut your mouth .
let heaven and men and devils tell me to shut me up .
if you ’ re smart , you ’ ll go home .
i won ’ t .
shame on you !
drawing your sword on a woman ?
oh , you stupid moor !
i found that handkerchief by accident and gave it to my husband .
he ’ d begged me to steal it many times .
you evil whore !
you think she gave it to cassio ?
no , i found it and gave it to my husband .
you piece of filth , you ’ re lying !
i swear i ’ m not lying .
you absolute villain !
he ’ s killed his wife !
yes , yes !
lay me next to my mistress .
he ’ s gone , and his wife ’ s dead .
kill him rather than let him leave this room .
but why should my reputation for honor last longer than my honor did ?
let it all go .
what did your song mean , lady ?
can you hear me ?
i ’ ll die like a swan .
they sing when they die .
here it is .
uncle , i ’ m coming out !
look in on me , and talk with me , or i ’ ll attack even without a weapon .
what ’ s the matter ?
look , i have a weapon , the best sword a soldier could have .
i ’ ve fought my way through obstacles twenty times more terrifying than you with this weapon .
but
who can control his fate ?
i ’ m not like that now .
don ’ t be afraid , even though you see me with a weapon .
this is the end of my journey , the end of my life .
are you backing away in fear ?
there ’ s no reason to be afraid .
where would othello go ? — oh , look at you !
you ’ re as pale as your nightgown !
when we meet on judgment day , that look of yours will send me from heaven to hell , where devils will grab me .
you ’ re cold , cold , and you were never hot with lust .
oh you damned villain !
whip me , you devils , so i don ’ t have to look at this heavenly sight !
where is that poor rash man ?
you mean the man who used to be othello ?
here i am .
where ’ s that snake ?
bring the villain forward .
i don ’ t like it that you knew about this , iago .
damn it , you ’ re not listening to me !
you told me you hated him .
i do hate
but that ’ s just a fairy tale .
if you are a devil , i won ’ t be able to kill you .
take his sword away from him .
i ’ m bleeding , but you didn ’ t kill me .
i ’ m not sorry , either .
i want you to live , since to me , death is happiness .
say anything .
this poor guy ’ s partly confessed his plan .
did you plan cassio ’ s death with him ?
yes .
dear general , i never gave you any reason to hate me .
i believe you , and i ask you to forgive me .
will you please make this half-devil say why he tricked me and damned my soul ?
don ’ t ask me anything .
you know what you know .
from this moment on , i ’ ll never say another word .
what , not even to pray ?
well , do your best .
this one talks about how roderigo should kill cassio .
oh , you villain !
ungodly and monstrous !
oh , you wicked scoundrel !
cassio , how did you get my wife ’ s handkerchief ?
i found it in my room , and iago just confessed that he put it there for his own purposes .
you ’ re stripped of your power and your command , and cassio will govern cyprus .
as for this slave , iago , if we can think of any torture that will hurt him a lot but keep him alive a long time , he ’ ll have it .
you ’ ll remain a prisoner until we bring your crimes to the venetian government . — okay , take him away .
but enough about that .
when you record these sad events in your letters , please describe me exactly as i am .
don ’ t tone things down or exaggerate them out of hostility .
if you ’ re being fair , you ’ ll have to describe me as someone who loved too much , but who wasn ’ t wise about it .
write all this
down , and then say also that in aleppo i once saw a turk beating a venetian , so i grabbed the turk by the throat and hit him like this .
oh , what a bloody end to all this !
everything we ’ ve heard is bad .
i was afraid this would happen , because he was a noble , brave man , but i didn ’ t think he had a weapon .
what do you think about this change ?
they can ’ t have changed ; there ’ s no way this could be true .
it ’ s a trick to confuse us .
here ’ s some more news coming in .
that ’ s just what i thought .
how many , can you guess ?
thirty ships .
now they ’ ve turned around and are clearly heading for cyprus .
signor montano , your brave and loyal servant , gives you this information and asks you to send reinforcements to relieve him .
then it ’ s certain they ’ re heading for cyprus .
is marcus luccicos in town ?
no , he ’ s in florence .
write to him immediately .
hurry .
here come brabantio and the brave moor .
forgive me , your grace .
why , what ’ s the matter ?
it ’ s my daughter !
oh , my daughter !
is she dead ?
she ’ s dead to me .
i humbly thank you , sir .
we ’ re sorry to hear this .
nothing , but this is true .
there ’ s nothing more .
i ’ m awkward in my speech and i ’ m not a smooth talker .
she blushes at the slightest thing .
the devil must be behind this .
therefore i say again that he must have used some powerful drug or magic potion on her .
tell us , othello .
or did you agree to this as equals ?
of her father .
bring desdemona here .
you know where she is .
in the meantime i ’ ll tell you all , as honestly as i confess my sins to god , how i wooed this beautiful lady , and how she came to love me .
tell us , othello .
her father loved me and used to invite me to his house often , continually asking me about my life and all the battles i ’ ve fought .
when i talked about all these things , desdemona used to listen attentively .
she said she wished she hadn ’ t heard it , but she also wished there was a man like me for her .
she thanked me and told me that if a friend of mine had a story like mine to tell , she ’ d fall in love with him .
i took the hint and spoke to her .
she said she loved me for the dangers i ’ d survived , and i loved her for feeling such strong emotions about me .
that ’ s the only witchcraft i ever used .
here comes my wife now .
she ’ ll confirm everything .
i think a story like that would win my own daughter over .
please let her speak .
if she admits she wanted this , then i won ’ t blame othello . — come here , my child .
who do you obey here ?
father , this isn ’ t easy for me .
i ’ m torn .
you ’ re the one i have to obey .
i ’ m your daughter .
i ’ m finished , then .
duke , please go ahead with your state business .
i ’ d rather adopt a child than have one of my own . — come here , moor .
with all my heart , i give you that thing which , if you didn ’ t already have it , i ’ d try with all my heart to keep from you .
you would have made me treat them like a tyrant . — i ’ m done , my lord .
let me refer to a proverb that may help you forgive these lovers : if you can ’ t change something , don ’ t cry about it .
please , i ’ m asking you , go ahead and get back to your state affairs .
the turks are heading for cyprus with a powerful fleet .
she can stay at her father ’ s house .
i won ’ t allow it .
neither will i.
dear duke , please listen to what i have to say .
what do you want to do , desdemona ?
when i fell in love with othello i made up my mind that i wanted to live with him .
i saw othello ’ s true face when i saw his mind .
let me go with him .
please allow her to do this .
you can decide that privately .
what ’ s important is the urgency of this mission .
you ’ ll have to leave tonight .
with all my heart , i ’ ll go right away .
we ’ ll meet again at nine in the morning .
othello , have one of your officers stay behind to bring you your commission and whatever else is important to you .
he ’ ll accompany my wife , and bring whatever else you think i might need .
which any peace-lover can do .
his military understanding is all theory , no practice .
and there ’ s nothing i can do about it .
that ’ s the curse of military service .
now , you tell me : should i feel loyal to the moor ?
if you don ’ t like him you should quit .
no , calm down .
i ’ m serving under him to take advantage of him .
we can ’ t all be masters , and not all masters should be followed .
look at all the devoted servants who work for their masters their whole lives for nothing but their food , and then when they get old they ’ re terminated .
they ought to be whipped for being so stupid .
let me tell
all right , then .
treat desdemona well .
keep an eye on her , moor .
she lied to me , and she may lie to you .
iago , i ’ m leaving my dear desdemona with you .
have your wife attend to her , and bring them along as soon as you can .
come on , desdemona , i ’ ve only got an hour of love to spend with you , to tell you what you need to do .
we ’ re on a tight schedule .
iago .
what do you have to say , noble friend ?
what do you think i should do ?
go to bed , and sleep .
i ’ m going to go drown myself .
if you do that , i ’ ll never respect you again .
why , you silly man !
oh , how stupid !
i ’ ve been alive for twenty-eight years , and i ’ ve never met a man who knew what was good for him .
i ’ d rather be a baboon than kill myself out of love for some woman i can ’ t have .
what should i do ?
i know it ’ s foolish to be so much in love , but i can ’ t help it .
can ’ t help it ?
nonsense !
what we are is up to us .
our bodies are like gardens and our willpower is like the gardener .
if we didn ’ t have rational minds to counterbalance our emotions and desires , our bodily urges would take over .
thankfully , we have reason to cool our raging lusts .
i don ’ t believe it .
you feel love because you feel lust and you have no willpower .
come on , be a man .
drown yourself ?
drowning is for cats or blind puppies — don ’ t drown yourself !
i ’ ve told you i ’ m your friend , and i ’ ll stick by you .
i ’ ve never been more useful to you than i will be now .
here ’ s what you ’ ll do .
moors are moody people . — so sell your lands and raise a lot of cash .
what seems sweet to him now will soon turn bitter .
she ’ ll have to have it .
so have your money ready .
if you want to go to hell , there are better ways to do it than killing yourself .
raise all the money you can .
i can get the better of religion and a few flimsy vows between a misguided barbarian and a depraved venetian girl .
and to hell with drowning yourself !
that ’ s completely beside the point .
you can trust me .
go now and get cash .
i told you before , and i ’ ll tell you again and again : i hate the moor .
so let ’ s join forces and get revenge .
go get money .
we ’ ll speak again tomorrow .
goodbye .
where will we meet in the morning ?
at my house .
i ’ ll be there early .
no more talk about killing yourself , okay ?
i ’ ve changed my mind about that .
go then , goodbye .
put a lot of cash together .
i ’ m going to sell all my land .
that ’ s how i always do it , getting money from fools .
i ’ d be wasting my skills dealing with an idiot like that if i couldn ’ t get something useful out of him .
i hate the moor , and there ’ s a widespread rumor that he ’ s slept with my wife .
i ’ m not sure it ’ s true , but just the suspicion is enough for me .
he thinks highly of me .
cassio ’ s a handsome man .
let ’ s see , how can i
get his position and use him to hurt othello at the same time ?
how ?
how ?
let ’ s see .
i ’ ve worked it out .
what can you see out on the ocean ?
nothing .
it was windy on shore too .
a big blast of wind shook our fortifications .
what do you think will be the result of this storm ?
the turkish navy will be broken up .
the wind ’ s whipping up the waves so high you expect them to reach the clouds and splash against the stars in the sky .
i ’ ve never seen the waters so disturbed .
if the turkish fleet isn ’ t protected in some harbor , their men must all be drowned .
no ship could survive this storm .
i ’ ve got news , boys , the war ’ s over !
this terrible storm has smashed the turks so badly that their plans are ruined .
one of our ships has reported that it saw most of their fleet shipwrecked .
what ?
is this true ?
michael cassio , lieutenant of the moor othello , has arrived on shore .
the moor himself is still at sea .
i ’ m happy about that .
he ’ ll be a good governor .
the two of them were separated during the storm .
i hope to god othello ’ s all right .
let ’ s do that .
every minute we expect more ships to arrive .
thanks , you brave men who defend this island and respect othello .
i hope heaven protects him from the weather , because i lost sight of him on the stormy sea .
is his ship sturdy ?
yes , it ’ s well built , and the ship ’ s pilot is very expert and experienced .
what ’ s all that shouting about ?
please go find out for certain who has arrived .
i ’ ll do that .
good lieutenant , is your general married ?
a man named iago , the general ’ s ensign .
who ’ s that ?
look , the precious desdemona has arrived on shore .
we should all kneel before her , men of cyprus !
greetings , my lady , and may god always be with you .
thank you , brave cassio .
is there any news about my husband ?
he hasn ’ t arrived yet .
as far as i know , he ’ s okay and will arrive here soon .
oh , but i ’ m worried .
how did you two get separated ?
the storm separated us .
go find out the news .
you , as sure as your name ’ s roderigo , if i were the moor i wouldn ’ t want to be iago .
i ’ m not who i appear to be .
do it , and shout like the city ’ s on fire .
hey , brabantio !
signor brabantio , hey !
thieves !
thieves !
check on your daughter , your house , your money !
thieves !
thieves !
if she gave you as much lip as she gives me , you ’ d be sick of her by now .
she ’ s always talking when i want to sleep .
i admit that in front of you , my lady , she keeps a bit quiet .
you have no reason to say that .
come on , come on .
in your own kitchens you act like wildcats .
shame on you , you slanderer !
no , it ’ s true , or if it ’ s not , i ’ m a villain .
you wake up to have fun , and you start work when you go to bed .
no , i don ’ t .
but if you had to say something nice about me , what would you say ?
don ’ t make me do it , my lady .
i ’ m critical by nature .
yes , madam .
i ’ m not as happy as i seem .
come on , what would you say about me ?
very clever !
even if she ’ s ugly , she ’ ll be smart enough to find a guy to sleep with her .
this is getting worse and worse !
what if she ’ s pretty but stupid ?
you don ’ t know a thing !
you give your best praise to the worst women .
but how would you praise a truly good woman , someone who had no reason to worry about what anyone said about her ?
would raise babies and clip coupons .
oh , that ’ s pathetic !
don ’ t listen to him , emilia , even though he ’ s your husband .
what do you think about him , cassio ?
isn ’ t he a horrible man ?
he speaks bluntly , madam .
he ’ s more of a soldier than a wise man .
i recognize his trumpet .
yes , it is .
let ’ s go greet him when he lands .
look , here he comes .
my beautiful warrior !
my darling othello !
i ’ m amazed you got here before me .
but i ’ m overjoyed !
if i died right now i ’ d be completely happy , since i ’ ll probably never be as happy as this again in my life .
god willing , our love and our happiness will only increase as we get older .
amen to that !
i can ’ t talk about my happiness anymore .
it ’ s too much .
let ’ s go up to the castle .
good news , friends .
the war ’ s over and the turks are drowned .
how are my old friends from this island doing ? — honey , they ’ ll love you here in cyprus .
and bring the ship ’ s captain to the castle .
he ’ s a good man . — let ’ s go , desdemona .
meet me down at the harbor . — come here .
lieutenant cassio will be on guard duty tonight .
but first , i have to tell you that desdemona ’ s completely in love with him .
with cassio ?
that ’ s impossible .
be quiet and listen to me .
othello isn ’ t any of those things .
now , if that ’ s true — and it ’ s obviously true — who ’ s in a better position than cassio ?
besides , he ’ s young and handsome , and he ’ s got all the qualities that naïve and silly girls go for .
i can ’ t believe that .
she ’ s very moral .
like hell she is !
if she were so moral , she would never have fallen in love with the moor in the first place .
good lord !
did you see that ?
they were lusting after each other .
disgusting !
but listen to me ; let me guide you .
i brought you here from venice .
be on guard duty tonight .
cassio doesn ’ t know you .
i ’ ll be nearby .
make cassio angry somehow , either by speaking too loud , or insulting his military skills , or however else you want .
all right .
he ’ s hot-tempered , and he might try to hit you with his staff .
try to get him to do that .
to get what you want , you need to get cassio out of the way .
i ’ ll do it , if you help me out .
i promise i will .
meet me in a little while at the citadel .
i need to get othello ’ s things from the ship .
goodbye .
goodbye .
i won ’ t be satisfied until i get even with him , wife for wife .
if i can ’ t do that , i can at least make the moor so jealous that he can ’ t think straight .
for besides the good news , we are also celebrating his marriage .
that ’ s the end of the announcement .
there will be a feast from five o 'clock until eleven .
god bless the island of cyprus and our noble general othello !
iago ’ s a good man .
goodnight , michael .
come talk to me tomorrow as early as you can . — come with me , my dear love .
good night , everyone .
hello , iago .
it ’ s time for us to stand guard .
the general got rid of us early tonight so he could be with desdemona . — i can ’ t blame him .
what ’ s the reason for this horrible shouting ?
what ’ s the matter ?
sir , is everyone in your family at home ?
are your doors locked ?
why are you asking me that ?
for god ’ s sake , sir , you ’ ve been robbed .
your heart ’ s going to break .
it ’ s like half your soul ’ s been ripped out .
at this very minute an old black ram is having sex with your little white lamb .
wake up , wake up , ring a bell and wake up all the snoring citizens .
get up , i tell you !
are you crazy ?
do you recognize my voice , noble lord ?
not me .
who are you ?
my name ’ s roderigo .
i told you not to hang around my house .
i ’ ve already told you quite plainly that my daughter will never marry you .
sir , sir , sir —
yes , she ’ s young and tender .
like an invitation .
but she ’ s modest and ladylike too .
and when she speaks , doesn ’ t her voice stir up passion ?
she ’ s a perfect woman , it ’ s true .
well , good luck to them tonight in bed !
not tonight , iago .
i ’ m not much of a drinker .
i wish there was less social pressure to drink .
oh , but these are our friends .
just one glass .
i ’ ll do most of the drinking for you .
i ’ ve already had a glass of wine tonight , watered down , but look how drunk i am .
what are you talking about , man ?
tonight is for celebrating !
where are they ?
by the door .
please invite them in .
i ’ ll do it , but i don ’ t like it .
if i can just get him to drink one more glass after what he ’ s drunk already , he ’ ll be as argumentative and eager to fight as a little dog .
now i ’ ll get cassio to do something in front of all these drunkards that will offend everyone on the island .
here they come .
if the future turns out as i hope it will , i ’ m all set for success .
my god , they ’ ve given me a lot to drink .
no , it was a little one , not more than a pint .
bring in more wine !
my god , what a great song !
i learned it in england , where they have a talent for drinking .
the danes , the germans , and the dutch — come on , drink , drink ! — are nothing compared to the english .
are englishmen really such heavy drinkers ?
they drink danes under the table , and it takes them no effort at all to out-drink germans .
let ’ s drink to our general !
i ’ ll drink as much as you do !
oh , sweet england !
god , that song ’ s even better than the other one .
do you want to hear it again ?
no , because we shouldn ’ t be doing that — stuff .
oh well , god ’ s in charge , and some people have to go to heaven , while other people have to go to hell .
that ’ s true , lieutenant .
speaking for myself — and no offense to the general or anyone else — i hope i ’ m going to heaven .
me too , lieutenant .
okay , but please not before me .
the lieutenant has to get to heaven before the ensign .
but let ’ s stop this drinking and get down to business . — god forgive our sins ! — gentlemen , let ’ s get down to business .
by the way , i don ’ t want anyone thinking i ’ m drunk .
i ’ m not drunk .
i can stand well enough , and i can speak just fine .
yes , you ’ re speaking very well .
yes , very well .
so don ’ t think that i ’ m drunk .
it ’ s too bad .
but is he often like this ?
he drinks like this every night before he goes to sleep .
he ’ d stay up all night and all day if he didn ’ t drink himself to sleep .
the general should be informed about this .
don ’ t you think so ?
and it ’ s too bad that the moor chose a man with such a deep-rooted drinking problem as his second-in-command .
we should definitely say something to the moor .
well .
now i ’ ve done a good day ’ s work .
you must all keep up this united front .
don ’ t simply hide your hatred .
swear your love for each other .
on my honor , i swear i love rivers with all my heart .
and i love hastings with all my heart .
take my hand , hastings .
dorset , embrace hastings . — hastings , express your affection for the marquess of dorset .
i swear i will never break this promise of love .
and so do i , my lord .
now , noble buckingham , seal this alliance by embracing my wife ’ s friends , and make me happy in your unity .
noble buckingham , your promise is like medicine to my ailing heart .
and just in time , here he comes with sir richard ratcliffe .
good morning to my sovereign king and queen .
happy indeed , the way we have spent the day .
what blessed work , my king .
i hate it and want all good men ’ s love .
today shall always be remembered as a holy day .
if only all struggles ended this well .
please pardon our brother clarence .
why , madam , have i offered you my love only to be flouted in front of the king ?
who doesn ’ t know that the good duke is dead ?
who doesn ’ t know he ’ s dead ?
who says he is ?
oh my god , what a terrible world this is !
do i look as pale as everyone else does , lord dorset ?
is clarence dead ?
but i reversed the death sentence .
well , the poor man died by your first order , which was carried by a winged messenger .
some tardy cripple must have taken the counter-order , who came after clarence was already buried .
it ’ s clear that someone less noble , less loyal , more bloody-minded than clarence but not a blood relation , deserves as bad an end as my brother , but he goes free .
please be quiet .
my soul is full of sorrow .
i will not rise until your highness hears me .
then hurry up and tell me what you want .
that you lift the death sentence on my servant , who killed a rowdy and belligerent former servant of the duke of norfolk .
we know you have a job to do , brakenbury , and we ’ ll do what you say .
farewell , brother .
it doesn ’ t make either of us happy , i know .
well , your imprisonment won ’ t last long .
i will either get you out , lying if i have to , or stay in prison in your place .
in the meantime , be patient .
i have no choice .
goodbye .
go walk the path that you will never return from .
i love you so much that i ’ ll send your soul to heaven very soon — if heaven will accept anything from me , that is .
but who ’ s coming ?
good afternoon , my dear lord !
the same to you , my lord !
welcome to the open air again .
how did you tolerate prison ?
but his punishment was bitter death .
who pleaded with me to pardon
this is what happens when you act rashly .
did you notice how the queen ’ s guilty relatives turned pale when they heard about clarence ’ s death ?
oh , they continually urged the king to do it .
god will revenge it .
but come , lords , will you come with me to edward ’ s room to comfort him ?
we ’ ll come with you , your grace .
tell me , good grandmother , is our father dead ?
no , boy .
my pretty children , both of you misunderstand me .
so you ’ re admitting clarence , my father , is dead .
my uncle the king is to blame for this .
god will take revenge .
and so will i.
quiet , children , quiet .
the king loves you very much .
innocent sweethearts , you have no idea who ’ s responsible for your father ’ s death .
you think my uncle was lying , grandmother ?
yes , boy .
i can ’ t believe that .
what ’ s that noise ?
i plan to fall into the blackest despair .
why are the branches still living when the root is gone ?
why aren ’ t the leaves withering now that the sap is all dried up ?
if you do intend to live , then mourn .
if you ’ re going to die , be quick about it so you can catch the king ’ s departing soul or follow him , like obedient subjects , to his new kingdom of endless night .
since your woes are only a portion of mine , i have every reason to surpass your lamentations and drown out your cries with my own .
i could drown the world .
my poor husband , my dear edward !
our poor father , clarence !
my sons edward and clarence !
what support did i have other than edward ?
and now he ’ s gone .
what support did we have besides our father ?
and now he ’ s gone .
and now they ’ re both gone .
there has never been a widow who suffered such loss as me .
there have never been orphans who ’ ve suffered what we have .
there was never a mother who suffered so much loss .
alas , i am the mother of all these others ' griefs .
she weeps for edward and so do i , while she does not weep for clarence , though i do .
these young children cry for clarence and so do i , though they don ’ t cry for edward , as i do .
be a careful mother , madam , and think about your son , the young prince .
your peace of mind depends on him .
sister , calm down .
all of us have reason to mourn the dimming of our shining star the king .
on my knee , i humbly ask your blessing .
god bless you and make you obedient , loving , and kind .
you mournful princes and grieving gentlemen who have been sharing this burden of grief , now it ’ s time to cheer each other up with love .
though we have lost a generous king , we are about to enjoy the benefits of a new king .
we must preserve our goodwill toward each other and not break into factions again .
i think a few members of the court should fetch the young prince from wales and bring him to london to be crowned our king .
why only a few courtiers , my lord of buckingham ?
the king made peace among all of us .
and so do i. i think we all do .
so , i agree with noble buckingham — only a few should go to meet the prince .
i think so too .
for god ’ s sake , my lord , let ’ s be sure to be part of the group that meets the prince .
along the way , i ’ ll find an opportunity to separate him from the queen ’ s proud relatives , as step one in the plan we ’ ve discussed .
you are my other self , my oracle , my prophet , my dear brother !
good morrow , neighbor , whither away so fast ?
i ’ m telling you , i hardly know myself .
did you hear the news that ’ s going around ?
yes , that the king is dead .
neighbors , hello .
good day to you , sir .
is it true that good king edward has died ?
yes , sir , it ’ s all too true , god help us .
then , gentlemen , we can count on trouble .
no , no , with god ’ s help , his son will be king .
it ’ s bad news when a country is ruled by a child .
his counselors will govern as long as he ’ s a minor , and then he ’ ll take over .
with patience , noble lord , as prisoners must .
it ’ s a shame that we eagles are caged up while the vultures are free to do whatever they please .
what ’ s the news abroad ?
very sad .
where is he , in his bed ?
he is .
you go ahead , and i will follow you .
that ’ s how it was with henry the sixth , who was crowned in paris when he was only nine months old .
really ?
it would be better if they were all on his father ’ s side , or that there were none at all on his father ’ s side .
richard , the duke of gloucester , is very dangerous , and the queen ’ s sons and brothers are haughty and proud — it would be better for this ailing country if they were subjects , not rulers .
come , come , we ’ re worrying about the worst-case scenario .
i ’ m sure everything will be fine .
when storms arrive early , you can expect the harvest will be damaged .
so , if all turns out fine , as you say , it ’ s more than we deserve or i expect .
it ’ s always like this in times of change .
but leave it all to god .
where are you all off to ?
the court has sent for us .
they ’ ll be here tomorrow or the next day .
i ’ m dying to see the prince .
i hope he ’ s grown a lot since i last saw him .
yes , mother , but i wish i hadn ’ t .
why , dear child ?
it ’ s good to grow .
well , it certainly wasn ’ t true for richard !
as a child , he took such a long time to grow up that , according to his rule , he should have grown up into a gracious adult .
and no doubt he is , gracious madam .
i hope he is , but mothers get to have their doubts .
hey , if i ’ d remembered something about him , i could have had a good comeback for my uncle , touching on his growth worse than he touched on mine .
what would you have said , my young york ?
do tell .
indeed , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw on a crust of bread when he was two hours old .
it took me two years before i had a single tooth .
grandmother , this would have been a biting joke .
pretty york , who told you about his teeth ?
his nurse , grandmother .
his nurse ?
why , she was dead before you were even born .
well , if it wasn ’ t her , i don ’ t know .
a mischievous child .
come , come , you are too clever for your own good .
good lady , don ’ t be angry with the child .
little pitchers have big ears .
here comes a messenger .
what ’ s the news ?
my lord , it ’ s news i wish i didn ’ t have to report .
how ’ s the prince ?
he ’ s fine and healthy , madam .
what is your news ?
the powerful dukes gloucester and buckingham .
what did they do wrong ?
i ’ ve told you everything i know .
why the nobles were imprisoned , and on what charges , i don ’ t know , my gracious lord .
oh no !
i see the downfall of my family .
welcome , destruction , blood , and massacre !
my husband lost his life to get the crown , and my sons ' fortunes have been tossed up and down , leaving me to rejoice over their victories and weep over their losses .
let it end , or let me die so i won ’ t have to watch any more of it .
the tiring journey seems to have made you gloomy .
it wasn ’ t the journey itself , uncle , but the troubles we encountered that made it wearisome and dull .
i want more uncles here to welcome me .
those uncles that you wish were here were dangerous .
your grace heard their saccharine words , but didn ’ t take note of their poisonous intentions .
god protect you from them and from other false friends !
god should keep me from false friends , but they weren ’ t false .
my lord , the mayor of london is here to greet you .
god bless your grace with health and happy days .
and what a slug hastings is that he hasn ’ t even arrived to tell us whether they ’ re coming !
and , just in time , here comes the sweaty lord .
welcome , my lord .
what , isn ’ t my mother coming ?
god knows why , but your mother and your brother have taken sanctuary in westminster abbey .
your sweet brother wanted to come meet you , but his mother wouldn ’ t let him .
i wouldn ’ t commit so serious a crime for anything .
in these less dainty times , you ’ re not breaking the laws of sanctuary to seize him .
the prince has done neither ; therefore , in my opinion , he isn ’ t really protected by sanctuary .
often i have heard of “ sanctuary men , ” but until now i ’ ve never heard of “ sanctuary children . ” my lord , you ’ ve won me over this time .
lord hastings , will you go with me ?
i ’ m coming , my lord .
go as fast as you can .
say , uncle richard , if my brother comes , where will i stay till my coronation ?
whatever seems best to you .
of all places , i don ’ t like the
he started it , my noble lord , and succeeding generations rebuilt it .
is it on record that he built it , or is it just word of mouth ?
on record , my gracious lord .
well , i think that even if it weren ’ t on record , the truth would be remembered from one generation to the next — all the way to doomsday .
what did you say , uncle ?
death didn ’ t conquer
the king won ’ t live , i hope .
i ’ ll marry the earl of warwick ’ s youngest daughter , lady anne .
so what if i killed her husband and her father ?
so that ’ s what i ’ ll do , not because i love her but because i ’ ll get something out of it .
but i ’ m running ahead of myself .
clarence is still alive ; edward is not only alive , he ’ s king .
only when they ’ re dead can i start to count my gains .
what , my dear lord ?
richard of york , how are you doing , my loving brother ?
very well , my supreme lord — that ’ s what i have to call you now .
how ’ s my nephew doing , noble lord of york ?
thank you for asking , uncle .
oh , my lord , you once said that lazy weeds grow fast .
the prince has far outgrown me .
he has , my lord .
does that mean he ’ s lazy ?
oh , my handsome nephew , i must not say that .
in that case , he ’ s more obliged to you than i am .
he may command me as my king , but you still have power over me as a relative .
uncle , please give me your dagger .
my dagger , little nephew ?
with all my heart .
are you begging , brother ?
from my kind uncle , who i know will give it to me , especially as it ’ s not worth much .
i ’ ll give you a greater gift than that , nephew .
a greater gift ?
that must mean a sword .
yes , gentle cousin , if it were light enough for you .
oh , i see , you will only part with lightweight presents .
for more important things , you ’ ll say no .
a sword ’ s too heavy for you to wear .
i wouldn ’ t think much of it even if it were heavier .
what ’ s that ?
but , uncle , you know how to bear with him .
you mean , to bear me , not to bear my protector , richard , insists on it .
i can ’ t sleep quietly in the tower .
why , what are you afraid of ?
my uncle clarence ’ s angry ghost .
my grandmother told me he was murdered there .
i ’ m not afraid of dead uncles .
nor living ones , i hope .
well , i hope not .
no doubt , no doubt .
oh , he ’ s a dangerously clever boy — bold , quick-witted , capable .
he ’ s his mother ’ s child from head to toe .
well , enough about them . — come here , catesby .
hastings loved the prince ’ s father so much that we won ’ t be able to persuade him to do anything against the prince .
what about stanley ?
won ’ t he join us ?
he ’ ll do whatever hastings does .
okay , just do this , noble catesby : sound out lord hastings , but make it seem as if you ’ re just mulling over the idea , that it hasn ’ t been firmed up yet .
if he seems game to our plan , encourage him to join us and explain all our reasons .
but if he ’ s resistant and chilly , then be like that too and break off the conversation .
give my regards to hastings , catesby .
my good lords , i plan to .
will we hear from you before bedtime , catesby ?
you will , my lord .
you ’ ll find us both at crosby place .
now , my lord , what are we going to do if we find that lord hastings won ’ t go along with our plans ?
chop off his head .
whatever we decide to do .
and when i ’ m king , remember to ask me for the earldom of hereford and all the possessions that go with it , which my brother the king used to own .
i look forward to that present .
you ’ ll find i ’ ll give it to you very willingly .
come , let ’ s have an early dinner so that we have time to work out our plans .
a messenger from lord stanley .
four o 'clock in the morning .
can ’ t lord stanley sleep ?
i guess not — for good reason , as you ’ ll soon hear .
first , he sends his regards .
and then ?
besides that , he says that two meetings are going to be held tomorrow , and something may be decided at one of them that may make you and him , who are at the other , sorry .
while he and i are at one , my loyal servant catesby will be at the other , so nothing will happen that we won ’ t find out about .
tell your master there is no sound basis for his worries .
and as for his dreams , i ’ m surprised he ’ s so foolish as to trust the fantasies of a restless night .
if we flee from the boar before the boar even pursues us , we ’ ll only make the boar angry and suspicious , causing him to chase us when he never intended to .
good morning , my noble lord .
good day , catesby .
you ’ re up early .
what news can you tell me in this fast-moving , unsteady state of ours ?
i believe it won ’ t stop moving and stand upright till richard wears the wreath of the realm .
what do you mean , “ wears the wreath ” ?
are you talking about the crown ?
yes , my good lord .
i ’ ll have my head cut from my shoulders before i ’ ll see the crown so misplaced .
but do you think that ’ s what he ’ s aiming for ?
for that reason he sends you this good news — that this very day your enemies , the queen ’ s relatives , will die at pomfret .
well , i ’ m not sorry to hear that , because they have always been my enemies .
well , let ’ s hope you stay in that noble frame of mind .
but as for now — before two weeks have gone by , i ’ m going to send some people packing .
it ’ s a horrible thing to die when you ’ re not prepared for it , my gracious lord .
yes , monstrous , monstrous !
that ’ s how it will be for some other men , too , who think they ’ re as safe as you and i , who are well-loved by noble richard and buckingham .
i know they do , and i certainly deserve it .
you ’ re afraid of the boar but you go around without your spear ?
my lord , good morning .
good morning , catesby .
my lord , my life is as important to me as yours is to you , and it was never as precious to me as it is now .
do you think i would be feeling as triumphant as i am if i didn ’ t know that our situation was secure ?
i hope to god i ’ m proven wrong !
well , should we head to the tower ?
the day is well on its way .
set down your honorable load , men , if there is ever any honor in being dead .
you know what , my lord ?
those men you just mentioned will be beheaded today .
they deserved to keep their heads more than some people who have managed to keep their positions .
but come , my lord , let ’ s go .
go on ahead .
i ’ ll talk with this good man .
what ’ s up , man ?
how ’ s it going ?
better , since your lordship was nice enough to ask .
i tell you , man , it ’ s better for me , too , than the last time we met here .
but now , i tell you — keep it to yourself , though — those enemies of mine are being put to death today , and i ’ m better than i ’ ve ever been .
well , let ’ s hope your good fortune continues !
here , drink to me .
god be good to you !
a nice coincidence , my lord .
i ’ m glad to see you .
i thank you , sir john , with all my heart .
i am indebted to you for your last sermon .
by next week , i ’ ll be able to pay you .
your friends at pomfret , they ’ re the ones who need a priest .
when i ran into this holy man , those men you mentioned did come to mind , in fact .
are you headed to the tower ?
i ’ ll be off before you are .
yes , probably , because i ’ m staying for lunch .
i ’ ll follow you , my lord .
hurry up .
your lives are over .
oh , pomfret , pomfret !
oh , you bloody prison , fatal and threatening to noble lords !
now margaret ’ s curse has fallen on our heads , for standing by and doing nothing when richard stabbed her son .
she cursed hastings then .
oh god , remember to hear her prayer for them , just as for us !
but don ’ t kill my sister and her royal sons , be satisfied , dear god , with our blood , which is being spilled unjustly , as you know .
hurry up .
the hour of death is approaching .
come , grey .
come , vaughan .
let ’ s embrace
in god ’ s name , speak .
when should the royal day be ?
is everything ready for that event ?
it is .
tomorrow ’ s a good day .
who knows what the lord protector thinks ?
who ’ s closest to him ?
you , i think , would best know what he ’ s thinking .
we know each other ’ s faces , but as for our thoughts , he doesn ’ t know any more about my thinking than i do about yours or his — or you do about mine .
lord hastings , you and he are close .
thank you .
i know he holds me dear , but i haven ’ t asked him about the coronation , and he hasn ’ t told me .
but you , my noble lords , may name a time , and i ’ ll second it on the duke ’ s behalf , which i don ’ t think he ’ ll mind .
right on cue , here ’ s the duke himself .
my noble lords and relatives , good morning .
if you hadn ’ t shown up on cue , my lord , lord hastings was going to take your part — i mean , he was going to speak for you — in the crowning of the king .
no one may be bolder than my lord hastings .
buckingham , i need to have a word with you .
i ’ ll come soon .
we have not yet set the coronation day .
where is my lord , the duke of gloucester ?
i have sent for the strawberries .
richard is looking cheerful today .
you always know he ’ s got some plan that pleases him when he says good morning with such gusto .
i don ’ t think there ’ s a man under the sun who ’ s worse at hiding his love or hate than richard .
i pray to god he isn ’ t .
then see the evidence of their evil with your own eyes .
if they have done this thing , my noble lord — if ?
you lover of that damned whore , you ’ re talking to me of “ ifs ” ?
you ’ re a traitor . — off with his head .
i pity england , but not myself .
stanley dreamed the boar beheaded him , and i laughed and refused to flee with him .
three times today my horse stumbled and started when he looked in the direction of the tower , as if he hated to carry me to this slaughterhouse .
oh , now i really need that priest who spoke to me today !
and i regret having bragged to the messenger about how my enemies were being butchered at pomfret while i , as i said , was in good standing with richard .
oh margaret , margaret , your heavy curse has now landed on poor hastings ’ s miserable head !
make your confession short .
he ’ s eager to see your head .
we spend more time seeking out the fleeting glories of this temporary world than looking to the permanent grace of god !
anyone who builds his hopes on air lives like a drunken sailor hanging on a mast , ready with every dizzy nod of his head to tumble to the bottom of the sea .
come , come , hurry up .
it ’ s pointless to talk now .
oh bloody richard !
miserable england , i foresee for you the most frightening time you have ever experienced . — come , lead me to the block .
bring him my head .
those who smile at it will soon be dead themselves .
frightening looks are also at my service , as are fake smiles .
but has catesby gone ?
a drum !
and if he ever has a wife , let her be more miserable when he dies than i am now .
what wicked magician has conjured up this devil to interrupt this sacred burial rite ?
lord mayor , the reason we have sent — look behind you !
defend yourself !
there are enemies here .
god defend and guard us innocents against them !
stay calm .
they ’ re friends — ratcliffe and lovell .
here ’ s the head of that notorious traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected hastings .
i loved this man so much it makes me weep .
he was so slick in covering over his plans that if it hadn ’ t been for his love affair with shore ’ s wife , i would never have suspected him .
he would have ?
what , do you think we ’ re turks or savages , instead of christians ?
i didn ’ t expect any better from him once he got involved with mistress shore .
but , my good lord , the words of you and lord buckingham are as trustworthy to me as if i had seen and heard him speak myself .
that is exactly why we wanted you here , your lordship — to avoid the public carping and complaints .
there was no limit to what his lustful eye and savage heart would prey on .
but only hint at this vaguely , because , as you know , my mother ’ s still alive .
goodbye , my lord .
if things go well , bring the crowd to i ’ m off .
around three or four o 'clock , look for news from the meeting hall .
lovell , go as fast as you can to doctor shaw .
now i ’ ll go inside and write out a secret order to keep clarence ’ s brats out of sight and to forbid anyone whatsoever from seeing king edward ’ s sons .
here ’ s the indictment of the good lord hastings , which has been written out in a clear hand , like any legal document , so it can be read aloud in public outside st. paul ’ s cathedral .
what a backward world we live in !
why , who ’ s so stupid that he can ’ t see through this fraud ?
the world is a bad place , where you can ’ t speak what you know .
it ’ s incredible — they didn ’ t say a word .
did you mention that edward ’ s children are bastards ?
i did .
he said that the people weren ’ t used to being spoken to except by the what blocks of wood !
they wouldn ’ t say anything ?
aren ’ t the mayor and his fellow citizens coming ?
the mayor is here at hand .
and make sure to carry a prayer book in your hand and to stand between two priests , okay ?
but don ’ t be easily won over .
i ’ m going now .
if you ’ re as good at pleading to them as i am at saying no to you , this will definitely come to a happy end .
hurry , go up to the roof .
the lord mayor is knocking .
welcome , my lord .
i don ’ t think he wants to be disturbed .
now , catesby , what does your lord say to my request ?
my lord , he asks that you please visit him tomorrow or the next day .
return to the gracious duke , good catesby .
tell him that the mayor , some citizens , and i have come to confer with his grace in matters of great importance concerning the general good .
i ’ ll tell him right away , my lord .
ah , my lord , this prince is nothing like edward !
he ’ s not sleeping to fatten up his lazy body , but praying , to nourish his attentive soul .
england would be lucky to have this virtuous prince as king .
but i ’ m afraid we ’ ll never get him to agree to be king .
but god forbid he says no to us !
i ’ m afraid he will .
here comes catesby again .
what ’ s up , catesby , what does your master say ?
my lord , he wonders why you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him , since he had no idea they were coming .
my lord , he ’ s afraid you mean him harm .
i ’ m sorry my noble brother is suspicious of me .
when devoutly religious men are praying , it ’ s hard to draw them out of it , because they get lost in the wonder of their contemplation .
see how he stands between two clergymen !
my lord , you don ’ t need to apologize .
i beg you to pardon me .
i suspect that i have committed some offence to the city and you have come to reprimand me for not knowing better .
you have , my lord .
sweet saint , for goodness ’ s sake , don ’ t be so angry .
if you enjoy looking at your awful deeds , take a look at this noteworthy example of your butcheries .
it ’ s your presence that draws out this blood from his empty veins .
oh earth , which soaks up this blood , revenge his death !
either let heaven send lightning to strike the murderer dead or let the earth open wide and devour him , as it does this good king ’ s blood .
if i don ’ t answer , perhaps you ’ ll think i ’ m accepting the heavy responsibility you foolishly want to impose on me .
so , thank god , there is no real need for me , as i wouldn ’ t be able to help you much .
the royal tree has left us other fruit , which , with time , will do just fine on the throne and make us all happy as king , i ’ m sure .
god forbid that i snatch the crown from him .
king edward was going to marry lady lucy — your mother can vouch for that — and then he was betrothed to bona , the king of france ’ s sister-in-law .
don ’ t refuse the love we offer you .
oh , make them joyful !
grant their law-abiding request !
alas , why would you heap all these responsibilities on me ?
i am unfit to rule and to be king .
please , don ’ t take it badly , but i cannot and will not give in to you .
but listen , if
oh , please don ’ t swear , my lord of buckingham .
if you refuse it , the whole country will regret it .
would you tie me to a whole world of worries ?
well , call them back again .
i am not made of stone ; i am affected by all these kind pleas , though it goes against my conscience and my soul .
god bless your grace !
we understand you ’ re just doing it for us , and we ’ ll be sure to say so .
if you say that , you ’ ll only be telling the truth .
then i salute you with this royal title : long live richard , england ’ s worthy king !
amen .
will you be crowned tomorrow ?
whenever you want , since you ’ re the one who wants it .
who ’ s this ?
my granddaughter , with her kind aunt , the duchess of gloucester , leading her by the hand ?
now , on my life , the young child must be headed to the tower to greet the young princes , whom she adores .
where are you going ?
just to the tower — i ’ m guessing , for the same reason you are : to salute the noble princes who are staying there .
yes , kind sister .
we can all go together .
and here comes the warden , just in time .
they ’ re just fine , my dear madam .
but i ’ m sorry — i ’ m not allowed to let you visit them .
the king has strictly forbidden it .
the king ?
who ’ s that ?
i meant to say the lord protector .
the lord keep him from the title of king !
richard has set boundaries between my love and theirs ?
i am their mother .
who ’ s going to keep me from them ?
i am their father ’ s mother .
i will see them .
i am their aunt , and i love them like a mother .
so take me to see them .
officer , i ’ ll take the responsibility from you , and the blame too .
no , madam , no .
i can ’ t do this .
i am bound by oath , so please forgive me .
in just an hour from now , duchess of york , i ’ ll be saluting you as the mother of two beautiful queens .
oh , cut my bodice-staps so that my pent-up heart can have some room to breathe , or i ’ ll faint from this deadly news !
cruel , cruel news !
your mother ’ s name has become a threat to her own children .
i ’ ll write to my stepson richmond on your behalf , so that he ’ ll meet you on the way .
but don ’ t delay .
o , this evil wind that spreads nothing but misery .
it has hatched a i go unwillingly .
i wish to god that the golden crown that i ’ ll have to wear were red-hot steel and burned me straight through to the brain !
if you want to make me happy , don ’ t wish yourself harm .
no ?
why ?
every night i ’ m awakened by his poor dear , goodbye .
i pity your situation .
no more than i do yours .
goodbye .
you are a rude , ragged nurse and an old , sullen playmate for such tender princes .
please treat my babies well .
dear woman , you don ’ t know the rules of charity .
villain , you don ’ t know the laws of god or of man .
even the fiercest wild animal has some touch of pity .
if i know nothing about pity , that must mean i ’ m not an animal .
it ’ s even stranger when an angel is so angry .
divine , perfect woman , give me a chance to prove in detail that i ’ m innocent of the evils you accuse me of .
contagious infection of humanity , give me a chance to condemn you for the evils i know you ’ ve committed .
you who are beautiful beyond words , calm down and let me explain myself .
you who are wicked beyond belief , the only “ explanation ” i ’ ll accept from you is for you to hang yourself .
such an expression of despair would only prove that i was guilty .
my gracious king .
give me your hand .
because of your advice and your help , i have a high position now .
but will i wear these honors for only a day or will i enjoy them for a long time ?
let them last forever .
oh buckingham , now i ’ m going to test to see if you ’ re truly made of gold .
young prince edward is still alive — what do you think i ’ m going to say next ?
go on , my loving lord .
ha !
but edward is still alive .
true , noble prince .
oh , how bitter it is that edward — the real “ true , noble prince ” — should still be alive !
cousin , you didn ’ t used to be so thickheaded .
shall i put it plainly ?
what do you say ?
your grace can do whatever he wants .
tut , tut , you ’ ve become rather icy .
tell me , do i have your consent to kill them ?
give me a little breathing space , my lord , a little pause to think .
i ’ ll let you know my answer shortly .
my lord ?
do you know anyone who would kill someone for money ?
what ’ s his name ?
his name is tyrrel , my lord .
i know the man a bit .
go , bring him here , boy .
look who ’ s here !
what ’ s the news with you ?
you should know , my loving lord , i ’ ve heard that the marquess dorset has fled to brittany , to the earl of richmond .
come here , catesby .
spread the rumor abroad that anne , my wife , is very sick .
and find a poverty stricken gentleman who i can marry straightaway to clarence ’ s daughter .
look at you , standing there in a stupor !
i repeat , spread the rumor that anne , my wife , is sick and likely to die .
are you tyrrel ?
james tyrrel — and your most obedient subject .
are you indeed ?
do you dare kill a friend of mine ?
well , that ’ s what you get to do .
two great enemies , in fact , enemies to my peace of mind .
tyrrel , i mean those bastards in the tower .
give me access to them , and soon you won ’ t have to worry about them anymore .
that ’ s music to my ears .
come here , tyrrel .
by this token , you ’ ll be admitted to their cell .
get up and listen to me .
that ’ s all there is to it .
as soon as the deed is done , you will be in my favor and i will promote you .
i ’ ll do it right away .
my lord , i have thought over the request you just made of me .
well , it doesn ’ t matter anymore .
dorset has fled to the earl of richmond .
i heard the news , my lord .
stanley , richmond is your wife ’ s son .
get information from her .
my lord , i ’ d want to have the gift you promised me on your honor : the earldom of hereford and all the possessions that go with it .
stanley , pay attention to your wife ’ s doings .
if she sends any letters to richmond , you will be accountable to me for it .
what do you say , your highness , about my just request ?
as i remember , henry the sixth prophesied that richmond would be king when richmond was only a foolish little boy .
a king , perhaps — my lord — how is it that the prophet didn ’ t tell me at the time that i would kill him ?
my lord , your promise of the earldom — richmond !
the last time i was in exeter , the mayor kindly showed me the castle there and called it “ my lord !
yes , what time is it ?
i ’ m reminding your grace what you promised me .
well , but what time is it ?
it ’ s almost ten o 'clock .
well , let it strike ten then .
why “ let it strike ” ?
because you ’ re like the lowborn fellow who strikes the bell — you keep interrupting my thoughts .
i am not in the giving mood today .
you ’ re bothering me .
i ’ m not in the mood .
is this really happening ?
does he reward my dedicated service with such deep contempt ?
did i work to make him king for this ?
oh , let me remember what happened to hastings and hurry to
it was the most ruthless massacre this country has ever been guilty of .
dighton and forrest , whom i hired to perform the butchery , are used to killing people , the bloody dogs .
their lips , like four red roses on a stalk , touched .
kind tyrrel , will your news make me happy ?
if my doing what you told me to makes you happy , then be happy , because i did it .
but did you see them dead ?
i did , my lord .
and buried , noble tyrrel ?
the tower ’ s chaplain has buried them , but to tell you the truth , i don ’ t know where .
tyrrel , come back shortly after dinner and tell me the details of their deaths .
in the meantime , think about how i can do you good and give you what you want .
see you soon .
i humbly say goodbye .
edward ’ s sons have been carried off by the angels and anne , my wife , has bid good night to the world .
now i go , a jolly , thriving wooer , to marry my brother edward ’ s young daughter , elizabeth , because i know richmond has his eye on her .
my lord !
is the news good or bad that you enter without knocking ?
bad news , my lord .
the bishop of ely has fled to richmond , and buckingham , backed by a hardy welsh army , is on the march .
ely joining richmond troubles me more than buckingham and his quickly assembled army .
let ’ s say i didn ’ t kill them .
then you might as well say they ’ re not dead .
but they are dead , and you killed them , you slave of the devil .
i did not kill your husband .
well , then he must be alive .
you ’ re lying .
queen margaret saw your sword steaming with his blood .
she provoked me with her lying mouth , accusing me of crimes i didn ’ t commit .
no , what provoked you was your own bloody mind , which never thinks about anything but butchering .
you killed this king , didn ’ t you ?
yes , i ’ ll grant you that .
you ’ ll grant me , you hedgehog ?
then let god grant me that you ’ ll be damned for that wicked deed .
oh , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous .
that will please god , who has him now .
he is in heaven , where you will never go .
let him thank me , who helped him get there .
i ’ ve lurked in the shadows here to watch the downfall of my enemies .
i ’ ll head to france soon .
it ’ s time to hide , wretched margaret .
who ’ s coming ?
ah , my poor princes !
if your gentle souls are still flying in the air and have not yet landed where they will remain forever , hover around me with your airy wings and hear your mother ’ s lament .
hover about her and tell her she got what she deserved , with her children dead before their time .
i ’ ve been crazed with so many miseries that my tongue has tired of lamenting and gone mute .
edward plantagenet , why are you dead ?
will you abandon such gentle lambs , god , and throw them to the wolves ?
have you ever slept before while such a terrible deed was done ?
let my sorrow have the upper hand .
you had a clarence , too , and richard killed him .
oh righteous god , how can i thank you enough that this meat-eating mutt preys on his mother ’ s children and forces her to join others in their grief !
o harry ’ s wife , do not triumph in my sorrow !
with god as my witness , i swear i have wept for yours .
your son edward , who stabbed my son edward , is dead .
your clarence , who stabbed my edward , is also dead .
richard , a fiendish spy for hell itself , still lives , but only long enough to buy souls to send below .
i pray that god ends his life before i die , so i can say , “ the dog is dead ! ”
oh , you prophesied that the time would come when i would want your help in cursing that humpbacked spider , that hideous toad !
and i was right , because where ’ s your husband now ?
your brothers ?
your two sons ?
now you have only the memory of what you were , which tortures you when you consider what you ’ ve become .
you once stole my position ; now you get to have the grief that goes with it .
your english sorrows will make me smile in france .
you who are so skilled in cursing , stay awhile and teach me how to curse my enemies .
remember your children as being sweeter than they actually were , and think of the man who killed them as worse than he is .
making your loss greater makes the person who caused it worse .
think like this all day , and you ’ ll learn how to curse .
my words are dull .
enliven them with yours !
your misery will make them sharp and piercing like mine .
but give words a chance .
if that ’ s true , then don ’ t be tongue-tied .
come with me , and let ’ s smother my fiendish son — who smothered your two sweet sons — in bitter words .
who ’ s blocking the way ?
the woman who might have blocked you from all the murders you ’ ve committed by strangling you in her cursed womb .
are you hiding your forehead with a golden crown , when , if there was any justice in this world , it should be branded with the murders you committed — your slaughter of the prince who held that crown , and of my sons and my brothers ?
tell me , you villainous lowlife , where are my children ?
where are the noble hastings , rivers , vaughan , grey ?
where is kind hastings ?
play , trumpets !
don ’ t let the heavens hear these chattery women abuse the lord ’ s anointed king .
play , i say !
either be calm and polite or i ’ ll drown you out with the music of war .
are you my son ?
yes , i thank god , my father , and yourself .
then patiently listen to my impatience .
madam , i ’ m a bit like you in that i can ’ t tolerate a tone of disapproval .
oh , let me speak !
go ahead , but i won ’ t listen .
i ’ ll be gentle and mild .
and brief , good mother — i ’ m in a hurry .
are you that impatient ?
god knows i waited for you in anguish , pain , and agony when i gave birth to you .
and didn ’ t i finally arrive to comfort you ?
so , what hour of comfort have i ever had in your company ?
name one .
you ’ re too bitter .
just listen this once .
i ’ ll never speak to you again .
so be it .
though i have far more reason , i don ’ t have as much energy to curse you .
but i say amen to everything she said .
wait , madam .
i need to speak a word with you .
i have no more royal sons for you to murder .
you have a daughter named elizabeth , who is virtuous and beautiful , aristocratic and full of grace .
and does she have to die for this ?
oh , let her live , and i ’ ll ruin her manners and her beauty .
so that she may live , i ’ ll say i cheated on edward and that she is not really his child .
don ’ t wrong her birth .
she has royal blood .
to save her life , i ’ ll say she doesn ’ t .
yes , as safe as her brothers ' lives were .
bad friends were .
my children would have enjoyed a better death if god had blessed you with a purer life .
whichever hand literally stabbed their tender hearts , you ’ re the one who gave the order .
no doubt the murderous knife was blunt till it was sharpened on your stony heart — you reveled in my lambs ' bloody guts .
madam , if i do as well as i think i ’ m going to do in these dangerous , violent wars , you and your relatives will have more good at my hands than you ’ ve ever had bad !
what good does heaven have in store that can do me any good now ?
the advancement of your children , noble lady .
advancement to some scaffold , to lose their heads .
no , advancement to the dignity and height of honor , to a high , imperial kind of glory .
and you ’ re not suited for any place except hell .
yes , and one other place , if you ’ ll only let me name it .
some dungeon .
your bedroom .
there is no rest to be had in any bedroom where you are !
exactly , madam , until i sleep with you .
well , explain — but do it fast so that your puny store of kindness isn ’ t used up by talking about it .
then know that from my soul i love your daughter .
i believe it .
what do you believe ?
that you love my daughter to spite your soul .
don ’ t be so quick to twist my meaning .
the one who makes her queen , of course .
who else should it be ?
what , you ?
what do you think , madam ?
how would you woo her ?
and madam , with all my heart .
come , come , you ’ re making fun of me .
this is not the way to win your daughter .
there isn ’ t any other way , unless you took on another form and became someone else .
but suppose i did all the things you named out of love for her .
then she has no choice but to hate you , as you purchased her love with murder .
whatever has already been done can ’ t be undone now .
men act imprudently sometimes , then realize their mistakes when they have time to think about them .
if i took the kingdom from your sons , i ’ ll give it to your daughter to make up for it .
if i have killed your children , i will have children with your daughter .
a grandmother is loved hardly less than a mother is .
your children caused you trouble in your youth , but mine will bring you comfort in your old age .
i can ’ t make up for everything that i ’ d like to , so accept such kindness as i can offer .
indeed , we have many good days to look forward to !
go , then , mother , to your daughter .
what should i say to her ?
that her father ’ s brother wants to be her husband ?
or should i say it ’ s her uncle ?
or should i describe you as the one who killed her brothers and her uncles ?
how can i describe you that will make you appeal to the young woman and will also agree with god , the law , my honor , and her feelings ?
claim fair england ’ s peace depends on this alliance .
she will purchase that peace with an everlasting war .
tell her that the king , who has the power to command people , asks her .
he asks her to do what god say she will be a high and mighty queen .
only to watch that title become worthless , as her mother has .
say i will love her everlastingly .
but how long will “ ever ” last ?
until her beautiful life ’ s end .
but how long will her beautiful life last ?
as long as heaven and nature extend it .
as long as hell and richard want it .
tell her that i , her king , am her lowly subject .
but she , your subject , hates such a king .
be eloquent on my behalf .
an honest tale succeeds best when it is told simply .
then tell her my loving story in simple terms .
you can ’ t tell a story simply when it ’ s a lie .
your answers are too shallow and too hasty .
oh no , my reasons are deep and as permanent as death .
don ’ t harp on that point , madam — it ’ s past .
i will harp on it till my heartstrings break .
now , by st. george , my knighthood , and my crown — the first you profaned , the second you dishonored , and the third you stole .
i swear — by nothing , because this is no oath .
st. george loses his holiness once then , by myself — you ’ ve misused yourself .
now , by the world — it ’ s full of your ugly wrongdoings .
by my father ’ s death — your life has dishonored his death .
what can you swear by now ?
by the future .
there are parents living whose children you have butchered ; they are now old withered plants who will moan over their losses as they grow old .
don ’ t swear by the future , because you ’ ve ruined it before it has even arrived .
may i only do well in these dangerous battles if my intention to repent and prosper is sincere !
my happiness and yours lie in her .
shall i be tempted by the devil ?
yes , if the devil tempts you to do good .
yes , if your memories do you no good .
yet you killed my children .
but in your daughter ’ s womb i will bury them .
should i go convince my daughter to marry you ?
and be a happy mother by doing so .
i ’ m going .
write to me very soon and i ’ ll let you know what she thinks .
many former friends of ours have gathered to meet the fleet and aren ’ t willing to beat it back .
word is that richmond is the navy ’ s admiral .
someone who can ride fast , go to the duke of here , my good lord .
catesby , fly to the duke .
i will my lord , as fast as i can .
ratcliffe , come here .
ride to salisbury .
oh , right , good catesby .
tell him to gather together the greatest army he can muster in a hurry and meet me right away at salisbury .
i ’ m off .
what would you like me to do at salisbury ?
why , what is there to do before i get there ?
your highness just told me that i should ride there before you .
i changed my mind .
stanley , what news do you have ?
nothing that you want to hear , my lord , but nothing so bad that i can ’ t mention it .
well , how nice , a riddle !
neither good nor bad .
why do you go around in circles when you could get to the point ?
once again , what ’ s the news ?
richmond is sailing on the sea .
let him sink there so the sea will cover him !
lily-livered coward , what ’ s he doing there ?
well , what do you guess ?
that , stirred up by dorset , buckingham , and morton , he ’ s coming to england to claim the crown .
they are my daylight , my life .
then i hope night shadows your day , and death takes your life !
don ’ t damn yourself .
i wish i were , so i could deprive you of both day and life .
there is no better one on earth .
is the throne empty ?
is the army without a leader ?
is the king dead , the empire dispossessed ?
what heir of the york family is there alive other than myself ?
and who is england ’ s king but an heir of the great york ?
therefore , tell me , what is he doing at sea ?
where is your army , then , to beat him back ?
where are your tenants and your followers ?
aren ’ t they at this very moment on the western shore helping the rebels land safely from their ships ?
then they ’ re cold friends to me .
what are they doing in the north when they should be in the west serving their king ?
they haven ’ t been commanded to go to the west , mighty king .
if your majesty would like , i ’ ll muster up my friends and meet you wherever and whenever you like .
most mighty sovereign , you have no reason to doubt my friendship .
i was never disloyal , and i never will be .
then go gather your men , but leave behind your son , george stanley .
my noble king , my friends have informed me that sir edward courtney and his brother , the haughty bishop of exeter , are now in my king , the guildfords in my lord , the duke of buckingham ’ s army — enough , you
the news i have to tell your majesty is that buckingham ’ s army has dispersed from sudden floods and heavy rainfall .
buckingham himself has wandered away alone to who knows where .
i beg your pardon .
yes , your highness .
even if we don ’ t fight foreign enemies , we ’ ll beat down these rebels at home .
while we ’ re talking here , a royal battle could be won and lost .
someone deliver the order that buckingham be brought to salisbury .
everyone else , march on with me .
but , tell me , where is the noble richmond now ?
at pembroke , or at harfordwest in wales .
now we wear the wreaths of victory on our heads .
i ’ m left with nothing to do in this weak , idle peacetime , unless i want to look at my lumpy shadow in the sun and sing about
won ’ t king richard let me speak with him ?
no , my good lord .
so be calm .
this is it is , my lord .
why , then , it ’ s my body ’ s doomsday .
today i ’ m going to get what i said i wished would happen to me if i was ever false to king edward ’ s children or his wife ’ s allies .
this is the day i ’ m going to get what i wished for when i wished that the person i most trusted would betray me .
this , this all-souls ' day , is my just desserts .
i tried to play games with god , and he turned my fake prayer on my head , giving me for real what i ’ d asked for as a joke .
this is how god forces wicked men to turn their swords against themselves .
i have done wrong , so i will suffer wrong .
i suspect his friends will join us .
he has no friends except those who are too afraid to defy him .
in his greatest need , even they will desert him .
all to our advantage .
so , in god ’ s name , let ’ s march .
hope with good cause is swift ; it flies as fast as a swallow .
it turns kings into gods and men of lower rank into kings .
my heart is ten times lighter than my looks .
my lord of norfolk — here , most gracious king .
norfolk , we ’ re going to have a few blows , right ?
we ’ ve got to give them and take them , my lord .
i ’ ll lie here tonight .
but where will i lie tomorrow ?
well , it doesn ’ t matter .
six or seven thousand , at most .
why , our troops amount to three times that .
besides , the king ’ s name is a tower of strength ; the opposition doesn ’ t have that advantage .
let ’ s be disciplined and not delay , because tomorrow is a busy day .
my lord of oxford , you , sir william brandon , and you , sir walter herbert , are going to stay with me .
good captain blunt , tell the earl goodnight from me , and tell him that by two in the morning i would like him to visit my tent .
unless i ’ ve mistaken his battle flags , which i ’ m sure i haven ’ t , his regiment lies at least half a mile south of the king ’ s mighty army .
if it ’ s possible to do this without putting yourself in danger , dear captain blunt , say goodnight to him from me and give him this important note .
upon my life , my lord , i ’ ll do it .
there is a man who loves you better than your husband could .
name him .
plantagenet .
yes , that ’ s my husband ’ s name .
someone else has the same name , but he ’ s a better man .
where is this man ?
here .
why do you spit at me ?
if only i could spit poison .
poison never came from such a sweet place .
poison never landed on such an ugly toad .
get out of my sight !
you ’ re poisoning my eyes .
your beautiful eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine with love .
i wish my eyes were
good night , dear captain blunt .
come , gentlemen , let ’ s discuss tomorrow ’ s action in my tent .
the night air is too raw and cold for us to stay outdoors .
what time is it ?
it ’ s dinnertime , my lord .
it ’ s nine o 'clock .
i ’ m not going to eat dinner tonight .
give me some ink and paper .
is the visor of my helmet working better now ?
and has my armor been put in my tent ?
my good man norfolk , hurry to your post .
i ’ m off , my lord .
get up early tomorrow — at the sound of the lark — noble norfolk .
i will , my lord .
catesby .
yes , my lord ?
yes , my lord ?
did you see the gloomy lord northumberland ?
thomas , the earl of surrey , and he were moving from troop to troop around twilight cheering up the soldiers .
good , i ’ m satisfied .
set it down .
is my ink and paper ready ?
it is , my lord .
ratcliffe , around midnight come to my tent and help me put on my armor .
now leave me alone , as i said .
let fortune and victory be yours !
i wish you all the comfort that such a dark night as this can offer , noble father-in-law .
tell me , how is my mother ?
your mother sends her blessings .
to be brief — as the occasion requires — prepare to fight early in the morning , when your future will be decided .
i can ’ t do everything i want to , but i ’ ll help you as well as i can .
but i can ’ t be too obvious about being on your side without risking the life of your stepbrother , young george .
farewell .
the lack of time and the risk i ’ m under will have to keep us from bonding and catching up on each other ’ s news the way we usually would after not seeing each other for so long .
i hope we have the time some day !
again , goodbye .
be brave and do well !
again , good night , kind lords and gentlemen .
oh god , whose side i think i ’ m fighting on , look kindly on my forces .
make us your agents of revenge , so we can praise you when we ’ re victorious !
before i fall asleep , i entrust my soul to you .
defend me , god , both when i ’ m asleep and when i ’ m awake .
i ’ m sweating and trembling with fear .
myself ?
yes , i am .
then run away .
what , from myself ?
why ?
did i do anything good to myself ?
oh , no .
i am a villain .
fool , do not flatter yourself .
give me another horse !
bandage my wounds !
have mercy , jesus ! — wait , i was only dreaming .
oh cowardly conscience , how you ’ re torturing me !
but what am i afraid of ?
myself ?
there ’ s no one else here .
richard loves richard , that is , there ’ s just me and myself here .
is there a murderer here ?
no .
yes , i am .
then run away .
what , from myself ?
unfortunately , i love myself .
why ?
did i do anything good to myself ?
oh , no .
alas , i hate myself instead , because of the hateful deeds i ’ ve committed .
i am a villain .
fool , speak well of yourself .
fool , do not flatter yourself .
my lord .
damn it , who ’ s there ?
ratcliffe , my lord , it ’ s me .
the rooster has already crowed twice .
your friends are up and buckling on their armor .
oh ratcliffe , i had a terrifying dream !
what do you think , will my friends prove loyal ?
no doubt , my lord .
by st. paul , ghosts have struck more terror in my soul tonight than ten thousand of worthless richmond ’ s soldiers could , dressed up in their most sword-proof armor .
it ’ s not yet daylight .
come with me ; i ’ ll spy under the tents to see if any of my own people plan to desert me .
good morning , richmond .
pardon me , lords and gentlemen who stayed awake .
how did you sleep , my lord ?
since you left , i ’ ve been enjoying the sweetest sleep and most promising dreams i ’ ve ever had , my lords .
i dreamed the souls of the people richard murdered came to my tent and promised me victory .
i tell you , i feel very jolly remembering such a beautiful dream .
how late is it , lords ?
it ’ s almost four .
why , then , it ’ s time to put on my armor and instruct the troops .
we have god and a good cause on our side .
the prayers of saints and those that richard wronged support us like high-walled fortresses .
other than richard , even those whom we fight against would rather we won .
because who is this man they follow ?
if you struggle to bring down a tyrant , you will sleep peacefully when the tyrant is killed .
when you fight against your country ’ s enemies , you will be paid for your efforts with your country ’ s wealth .
if you fight to protect your wives , your wives will welcome you home as conquerors .
when you free your children from the sword , your grandchildren will repay you in your old age .
so , in the name of god and all the good that will come of this
i wish they were , so that i could die right now , because , at this point , i live a living death .
i never tried to win over a friend or enemy with sweet words .
no , don ’ t pause , because i
what did northumberland say about richmond ?
that he was never trained as a soldier .
that ’ s true .
and what did surrey say to that ?
he smiled and said , “ the better for us . ” he ’ s right , and that ’ s how it is .
read the time there .
give me an almanac .
i didn ’ t , my lord .
ratcliffe !
my lord ?
the sun will not appear today .
the sky frowns and scowls on our army .
i wish there wasn ’ t so much dew on the ground .
so , the sun won ’ t shine today !
get ready , my lord .
the enemy is making its appearance on the battlefield .
hurry , hurry — prepare my horse .
john duke of norfolk and thomas earl of surrey will lead the horsemen and foot soldiers .
i ’ ll follow in the center of the troop formation , which i ’ ll defend with my best horse , and with saint george on my side , as well !
what do you think , norfolk ?
a good plan , warrior king .
i found this pinned to my tent this morning .
listen !
i hear their drums .
startle even the sky with the sound of your lances cracking .
what does lord stanley say ?
will he bring his army ?
my lord , he refuses to come .
off with his son george ’ s head !
my lord , the enemy has already passed the marsh .
let george stanley die after the battle .
let ’ s go !
victory is with us .
help , my lord of norfolk , help , help !
the king performs more wonders than seem humanly possible , challenging every enemy he sees .
his horse is killed , so he ’ s fighting on foot , risking his life to search out richmond .
help , dear lord , or the battle will be lost !
a horse , a horse , i ’ d give my kingdom for a horse !
get off the field , my lord .
i ’ ll find you another horse .
god and your work be praised , victorious friends .
great god of heaven , say amen to all this !
but , tell me , is young george stanley alive ?
he is , my lord , and safe in leicester , where , if you ’ d like , we can retreat to .
john duke of norfolk , walter lord ferrers , sir robert brakenbury , and sir william brandon .
as i vowed , i will unite the york and lancaster families .
smile , then , on this beautiful union .
what traitor hears me and doesn ’ t say amen ?
now let richmond and elizabeth , the true heirs of each royal house , be joined together !
gracious lord , blunt the swords of those traitors who mean to tear poor england apart again !
let those who would mar this fair land ’ s peace with treason die before they can enjoy its wealth .
civil wounds now can heal , and peace can live again .
so that england may live a long life like this , let god say amen !
take up the sword again , or take me up .
get up , liar .
though i wish you were dead , i ’ m not going to be the one to kill you .
i have already .
you said it when you were furious .
say it again — just one word , and my hand , which killed your lover out of love , will kill your far truer lover .
you will be an accessory to both crimes .
i wish i knew what was in your heart .
i ’ ve told you .
i fear that your words and your heart are both false .
then no man has ever been honest .
well , then , put your sword away .
tell me that you ’ ll accept my love .
you ’ ll know about that later .
but can i have some hope ?
i ’ d like to think all men have some hope .
please wear this ring .
wear both the ring and my heart , because both are yours .
and if i , your poor devoted servant , may ask you for one small favor , you will guarantee my happiness forever .
what ’ s that ?
for various reasons that must remain secret , please do this for me .
i ’ ll do it with all my heart .
say goodbye to me .
sirs , take up the corpse .
toward chertsey , noble lord ?
no , to the whitefriars monastery .
wait for me there .
has anyone ever courted a woman in this state of mind ?
and has anyone ever won her , as i ’ ve done ?
i ’ ll get her , but i won ’ t keep her long .
and yet , against all odds , i win her over !
ha !
has she already forgotten her brave husband , prince edward , whom i stabbed on the battlefield three months ago in my anger ?
he was graced with lots of natural gifts , he was young , valiant , wise , and no doubt meant to be king .
and yet she cheapens herself by turning her gaze on me , who cut her sweet prince ’ s life short and made her a widow ?
on me , though i am barely half the man that edward was ?
on me , though i am limping and deformed ?
i bet i ’ ve been wrong about myself all this time .
even though i don ’ t see it , this lady thinks i ’ m a marvelously good-looking man .
time to buy myself a mirror and employ a few dozen tailors to dress me up in the current fashions .
since i ’ m suddenly all the rage , it will be worth the cost .
but first , i ’ ll dump this fellow in his grave , then return to my love weeping with grief .
come out , beautiful sun — until i ’ ve bought a mirror to admire my reflection in , i ’ ll watch my shadow as i stroll along .
be patient , madam .
i ’ m sure his majesty will recover his health soon .
then you ’ ll be able to cheer if he were dead , what would happen to me ?
but he ’ s young , and as long as he ’ s too young to become king , richard , the duke of gloucester , has power over him .
richard loves neither me nor any of you .
has it been decided that richard will be it ’ s been decided , though not yet officially announced .
i hope god makes you happy again , like you once were .
did you see the king today , lord derby ?
yes , the duke of buckingham and i have just returned from visiting him .
what are the chances of his getting better , lords ?
madam , keep up hope .
he seems cheerful .
god give him health .
did you talk with him ?
yes , madam .
i wish i could believe you that all was well !
they ’ re out to get me , and i won ’ t stand for it !
which of you has been complaining to the king that i don ’ t like them ?
can ’ t a plain man live and do no harm to anyone without being taken advantage of by a bunch of slick , sneaky lowlifes ?
which of us are you referring to ?
you , who are neither honest nor good .
when did i ever do you any harm ?
or any of you ?
damn you all !
the king — whom i hope god will protect better than you would like — can ’ t get a minute ’ s rest without you bothering him with your outrageous complaints .
brother , you ’ ve made a mistake .
he i can ’ t tell what ’ s going on .
the world has become so bad that now little wrens have settled where eagles used to roost .
come , come , i know what you ’ re referring to , richard .
you resent my friends ' rise in society , and my own .
let ’ s hope we never need your help for anything .
meanwhile , we ’ re the ones who need you .
my brother is imprisoned because of you , i am disgraced , and the nobility are held in contempt while those who two days ago weren ’ t worth a dime have suddenly been promoted .
by the lord who raised me to this weighty post from the happy and carefree life i used to enjoy , i promise you i never did anything to get the king to turn against the duke of clarence .
since i can ’ t amuse myself by being a lover , i ’ ve decided to become a villain .
his majesty is so concerned about my personal safety that he has ordered them to conduct me to the you ’ re being arrested ?
why ?
because my name is george .
that ’ s not your fault !
he should imprison the person who named you , instead .
maybe the king is sending you to the tower to have you renamed .
but , really , what ’ s going on , clarence ?
can you tell me ?
she could even what ?
certainly , your grandmother had a worse match .
my lord of gloucester , i have suffered your blunt upbraidings and your bitterness toward me for too long .
by god , i will tell the king about these taunts .
i would rather be a country serving maid than a great queen if it meant i could escape your scorn and constant harassment .
i ’ ve had very little joy as england ’ s queen .
if you were king , we would do the same .
if i were king ?
i ’ d rather be a peddler .
hear me , you wrangling pirates .
which of you does not tremble when you see me ?
ugly , wrinkled witch , what are you doing here ?
only describing what you have ruined .
or at least that ’ s what i plan to do before i let you go .
weren ’ t you banished on pain of death ?
i was .
the sorrow that i feel actually belongs to you , and the high life you enjoy actually belongs to me .
oh , killing that child was the dirtiest , most merciless deed there ever was !
tyrants themselves wept when they heard about it .
even what , were you all snarling before i arrived , ready to catch each other by the throat like dogs , but now that i ’ m here , you turn your hatred toward me ?
all because of what happened to that brat rutland ?
enough of your magic spells , you hateful , withered hag .
and leave you out ?
don ’ t move , dog .
it ’ s your turn now .
richard .
yes ?
i didn ’ t call you .
i beg your pardon — i thought it was me whom you were calling all those terrible names .
yes , i was , but i don ’ t want an answer from you .
let me finish my curse .
i ’ ve finished it for you , and it ends in “ margaret . ” he ’ s turned your curse against you , margaret .
poor imitation queen , why do you align yourself with this humpbacked spider when he ’ s got you trapped in his deadly web ?
the day will come when you ’ ll wish i could help you cast spells against this poisonous , hunchbacked toad .
woman , stop your frantic curses and false prophesies before we run out of patience and do something bad to you .
shame on you ; i ’ ve already run out of patience with you all .
if you got what you deserved , you would learn some respect .
what i deserve is that you treat me like a queen , and what you deserve is to act like my subjects .
give me what i deserve , and do your duty !
people in high positions are shaken by many blasts of wind , and when they fall , they shatter into pieces .
good advice , indeed .
take it to heart , dorset .
it applies to you as much as to me , my lord .
but you turn that sun into a shadow .
you are building your nest in
stop — if you can ’ t be kind , at least have some shame .
how dare you talk about kindness or shame .
enough , enough .
your clothes aren ’ t spattered with my family ’ s blood , and you aren ’ t affected by my curse .
no one here is affected by your curse , because curses are just words with no power .
what is she saying , my lord ?
nothing that interests me , my good lord .
what , you ignore my kind advice and try to please the devil i ’ m warning you about ?
her curses have made my hair stand on end .
mine , too .
i don ’ t understand why she ’ s not locked up .
i can ’ t blame her .
i never caused her any harm , as far as i know .
but you have all the advantages from the harm done .
and look how he ’ s repaid poor clarence for his loyalty — penned him up like a pig being fattened for slaughter .
god pardon those who are responsible for clarence ’ s troubles .
i always pray for them
i ’ ll tell you as soon as i know , richard , because at this point i have no idea .
he picked out the letter “ g ” from the alphabet and said a wizard told him that “ g ” will take the throne away from his children .
he thinks “ g ” is me .
well , this is what happens when men let themselves be ruled by women .
the king isn ’ t the one sending you to the tower , clarence .
it ’ s his wife , lady grey , who got him to do this .
madam , his majesty asks for you , and for you , duke of gloucester , and for you , my noble lords .
we will wait on you , your majesty .
i do the wrong and am the first to start quarrels .
but quiet .
are you going to take care of this thing now ?
we are , my lord .
good thinking .
i have it on me here .
tut , tut , my lord , we ’ re not going to stand around chit-chatting .
talkers aren ’ t good doers .
rest assured that we ’ re going there to use our hands , not our tongues .
when fools cry , you remain stony .
i like you guys .
hurry now , get the job done .
we will , my noble lord .
why do you look so depressed today , your grace ?
what was your dream ?
tell me .
i thought i had escaped from the tower and was on a ship to france with my brother richard , who persuaded me to leave my cabin and walk on deck with him .
looking toward england , we reminisced about the countless frightening experiences we ’ d had in the wars between the yorks and the lancasters .
lord , how painful it was to drown .
i saw a thousand shipwrecks , a thousand men whom fish had gnawed to the bone , huge anchors , chunks of gold , heaps of pearls , and precious jewels — all scattered on the bottom of the sea .
so you had time as you were dying to look around ?
in fact , the real nightmare had only just begun .
with the help of the grim the first to greet me there was my great
clarence has arrived — lying , cowardly i ’ m not surprised it scared you , my lord .
it scares me just to hear you talk about it .
please spare my innocent wife and children ! — kind warden , please stay with me for a while .
i ’ m feeling very low , and i need to sleep .
i ’ ll stay , my lord .
may god bring you sleep !
sorrow interrupts all hours and seasons .
the only glory princes have are their titles .
what do you want , fellow ?
and how did you get in here ?
i want to speak with clarence , and i came here on my legs .
that ’ s it ?
well , sir , it ’ s better to say little than to be tedious .
it orders me to hand the noble duke of clarence over to you .
here are the keys , and there is the duke , sleeping .
you may , sir .
that ’ s a wise idea .
goodbye .
what , should i stab him while he sleeps ?
no .
when he wakes up !
why , he won ’ t wake up till judgment day .
okay , so that ’ s when he ’ ll say we stabbed him in his sleep .
that word “ judgment ” makes me feel a bit guilty .
what , are you afraid ?
not of killing him , because i have a warrant for it , but of being damned for killing him , which no warrant can protect me from .
i thought you were resolved to do this .
i am resolved — to let him live .
i ’ ll go back to the duke of gloucester and tell him so .
please , just wait a minute .
i ’ m hoping my holy mood will pass .
it usually only lasts about twenty seconds .
how are you feeling now ?
actually , i ’ m still feeling some pangs of conscience .
remember the reward we ’ re getting when the deed ’ s done .
jesus , let ’ s kill him !
i forgot about the reward .
where ’ s your conscience now ?
oh , in the duke of gloucester ’ s wallet .
when he opens his wallet to give us our pay , your conscience will fly out ?
it won ’ t matter .
let it fly out .
no one will listen to it .
and what will you do if it returns to you ?
i won ’ t bother with it .
it blushes , is easily embarrassed , and stages regular uprisings in a man ’ s heart .
i ’ m strong-willed .
he won ’ t get the better of me .
spoken like a brave man who respects his reputation .
shall we get to work ?
we ’ ll hit him on the head with the handles of our swords , then throw him in the wine barrel in the next room .
what an excellent idea — he ’ ll soak up the wine !
strike !
no , first let ’ s talk to him .
where are you , keeper ?
give me a cup of wine .
you ’ ll have wine enough , my lord , soon .
in god ’ s name , who are you ?
a man , like you .
but not a member of the royal family , like me .
and you ’ re not loyal , like us .
your voice is loud and commanding , but you look like a working man .
i ’ m speaking for the king , but i look like myself .
your eyes look threatening .
and why are you so pale ?
who sent you here ?
why are you here ?
to , to , to — to murder me ?
yes .
you barely have the heart to tell me , so you can ’ t possibly have the nerve to do it .
besides , how have i offended you , my friends ?
you didn ’ t offend us , you offended the king .
he and i will make up .
never , my lord .
so prepare to die .
it ’ s your job in life to kill the innocent ?
what did i do wrong ?
where ’ s the evidence against me ?
where ’ s the jury , the judge , the lawful proceedings , the verdict ?
who pronounced this death sentence before a court of law could even convict me ?
for you to threaten to kill me is most unlawful .
if you hope to have your sins forgiven by christ ’ s dear blood , which he shed for our terrible sins , you must leave and keep your hands off me .
what we do we have been commanded to do .
all right .
if you like , brakenbury , you can listen to anything we say .
we ’ re not saying anything treasonous , man .
we say the king is wise and good , and his noble queen is getting old , pretty , and not jealous .
and that mr. shore ’ s wife has nice feet , cherry lips , pretty eyes , and a very pleasant way of expressing herself .
what do you think ?
is there anything inaccurate in that ?
i have nothing to do with what you ’ re talking about , my lord .
her husband , you rascal .
are you going to get me in trouble ?
i beg your
and the one who commands us is our king .
he does , and now he ’ s taking revenge on you — for breaking promises and for murder , too .
whom you swore you would protect and defend .
how dare you tell us about god ’ s laws when you have broken them so savagely yourself ?
but for whose sake did i do that sick deed ?
for my brother edward ’ s sake .
if god will be revenged for this deed , he will do it publicly .
god doesn ’ t need to use indirect or illegal means to kill those who have offended him .
my brother ’ s love , the devil , and my own anger made me do it .
i am his brother , and i love him very much .
you ’ re mistaken .
richard , the duke of gloucester , hates you .
no , he loves and cherishes me .
go to him from me .
we will .
tell him that when our noble father , the duke of york , gave his three sons his blessing , he never imagined that our friendship would come to this .
remind richard of this , and he will weep .
yes , he ’ ll weep stones , as he taught us to do .
yes , as kind as snow to a harvest .
come on , you ’ re fooling yourself .
it ’ s richard who sent us here to slaughter you .
well , that ’ s what he ’ s doing — making you free to enjoy heaven .
make peace with god , for you must die , my lord .
you have enough holy feeling to advise me to “ make peace with god , ” but you ’ re willing to go to war with god by murdering me ?
oh sirs , consider this : those who sent you to do this deed will hate you for doing it .
relent , and save your souls .
if either of you were a prince ’ s son , and you were imprisoned as i am now , and two murderers like yourselves came to you — wouldn ’ t you beg for your life ?
yes , you would beg , if you were in my position .
relent ?
no .
that ’ s cowardly and womanish .
look behind you , my lord .
take that , and that .
a what ’ s going on ?
what did you mean by not helping me ?
by god , i ’ m going to tell the duke how slack you ’ ve been .
i wish you could tell him i saved his brother .
i ’ m not .
go , coward that you are .
well , i ’ ll go hide the body in some hole until the duke gives orders for his burial .
and when i get my reward , i ’ ll get out of here .
here comes your father .
don ’ t even think about refusing .
i must and will have katherine for my wife .
now , signior petruchio , how are you getting on with my daughter ?
beautifully , sir , beautifully !
now , daughter katherine ?
are you down in the dumps ?
you have the nerve to call me daughter ?
sir , this is the truth : you and the rest — all the people who have ever talked about her — have all been wrong .
she has the patience of a i ’ ll see you hanged on sunday first !
listen to that petruchio : she says she ’ ll see you hanged first .
is this your idea of success ?
so much for our plan .
relax , gentlemen .
i ’ ve made my choice .
if she and i are happy , what ’ s it to you ?
when we were alone , we agreed that in public she would go on being unpleasant .
i tell you , though , it ’ s incredible how much she loves me .
darling kate !
you men are rank beginners !
give me your hand , kate .
i ’ m off to venice to buy outfits for the wedding .
god give you joy , petruchio .
call it a match !
amen to that !
we ’ ll be your witnesses .
father , wife , friends — farewell !
i ’ m off to venice .
sunday is just around the corner .
we ’ re to be married on sunday .
was there ever a match put together so quickly ?
i ’ ve made a risky investment .
the only profit i seek is a peaceful match .
there ’ s no doubt that petruchio ’ s got quite a catch .
now , baptista , let ’ s turn to your younger daughter .
we ’ ve been waiting a long time for this day .
i ’ m your neighbor and came courting first .
callow youth , you don ’ t yet know how to love !
and you ’ re all sizzle .
stand back , boy .
age is the thing that nourishes .
enough , gentlemen .
i will settle this matter .
then , at my farm i have a hundred milk cows , a hundred and twenty fat oxen in my stables , and all the equipment necessary to maintain them .
two thousand ducats a year from his land !
i can ’ t offer her more than all i have .
i must admit your offer is the best .
otherwise — forgive me , but if you should die before him , what becomes of her dowry ?
oh , and young men never die ?
as you know , next sunday my daughter katherina is to be married .
i believe your honor is thinking of a character called soto .
yes , that was it .
you gave an excellent performance .
there is a particular lord who will watch you perform tonight .
go , lad , and take them to the pantry .
farewell , good neighbor .
your father would be a fool to give you all his wealth and spend his declining years as a guest in your house .
it ’ s absurd .
an old italian fox is never that generous , my boy .
sneaky , dried-up old coot !
usually fathers produce children , not the other way around .
but in this case of wooing , a child shall father his own father — if my wits don ’ t fail me .
i ’ ll have my lessons in the order and manner
where did we leave off ?
here , madam : translate .
now let me see if i can translate it .
there ’ s no need to be , really , for — you ’ re my teacher , so i must believe you .
but let it go . — now , litio , it ’ s your turn .
i hope , sir , that you ’ re not angry that i ’ ve been equally attentive to you both !
you call this a scale ?
i don ’ t like it .
i like doing things the old-fashioned way .
mistress , your father requests that you leave your books and come help decorate your sister ’ s room .
you know tomorrow is her wedding day .
farewell to both of you , dear teachers .
i have to go .
but there ’ s reason for me to look more closely at this schoolmaster .
he acts like a man in love .
the humiliation is all mine .
maybe , but i wish i ’ d never laid eyes on him .
go , daughter .
i cannot blame you now for weeping .
master , master !
i have news — old news such as you never heard before !
you say you have news that ’ s old ?
how can that be ?
well , is it not news that petruchio ’ s coming ?
is he here ?
why , no , sir .
what then ?
he is coming .
when will he be here ?
when he stands where i am and sees you there .
who comes with him ?
he ’ s dressed like a freak , a total freak , and not at all like a proper footman or a gentleman ’ s valet .
i am glad he ’ s coming , however he ’ s dressed .
why , sir , he ’ s not coming .
didn ’ t you just say he was ?
who ?
petruchio ?
yes , petruchio .
no , i said his horse is coming , with him on its back .
well , that ’ s the same thing .
no , by saint jamy , i ’ ll bet you a penny !
you are welcome , sir .
i ’ ll give you more instructions later .
i know the boy will be a convincing gentlewoman , taking up her exact walk and talk and gentle gestures .
i can ’ t wait to hear him call the drunkard “ husband , ” and to watch my men smother their laughter as they pay their respects to this simple peasant .
i ’ ll go and coach them .
where is my lovely bride ?
why , sir , you know this is your wedding day .
it ’ s a long story — and tough to listen to .
but where is kate ?
we ’ re wasting time here .
don ’ t greet your bride in these disgraceful clothes .
go to my room and put on something of mine .
not me .
i ’ ll see her like this .
but surely you ’ re not planning to
yes , just like this .
though i expect she ’ ll wear me out more quickly than i ’ ll wear out what i ’ m wearing — which will be good for her and even better for me !
but what a fool i am to stand here chatting when i should bid good morning to my bride and seal the bargain with a loving kiss .
he must be wearing this crazy outfit for some reason .
i ’ ll try to persuade him to put on something more appropriate before going to the church , if it ’ s at all possible .
i ’ ll go too and make sure that happens .
we ’ ll outwit them all — that old geezer , gremio ; the suspicious father , minola ; the prim musician lover , litio — all for the sake of my master , lucentio .
signior gremio , are you coming from the church ?
as eagerly as i ever came from school .
bridegroom ?
no , he ’ s a devil — a devil , i tell you !
why , she ’ s a lamb , a dove , a child compared to him !
she trembled and shook because he stamped and swore and carried on as though the vicar were trying to put something over on him .
finally , the ceremony done , he called for wine .
next he slung his arm around the bride ’ s neck and kissed her with such a smack that when they parted the sound of their lips made the whole church echo .
that was the limit for me .
it ’ s disgraceful !
there go the minstrels .
you ’ re not thinking of leaving tonight , surely ?
not tonight — today .
if you knew the reason , you ’ d understand and would urge me to go rather than stay .
good friends , i thank you all for coming to see me wed this patient , sweet , virtuous wife .
goodbye to you all .
can ’ t do it .
as a favor to nope .
as a favor to i ’ m delighted .
delighted to stay ?
delighted to hear you ask so nicely , but i won ’ t stay in any case .
look , if you love me , stay .
grumio , get me my horse .
yes , sir , they ’ re ready .
they ’ ve eaten themselves sick .
the door is open , sir .
go on , wear your boots out !
as for me , i ’ ll leave when i like .
calm down , kate .
please don ’ t be angry .
i will be angry .
what business is it of yours ? — father , be quiet .
he ’ ll stay as long as i say .
okay , now it starts !
gentlemen , on to the bridal dinner .
i see a woman may be made a fool of if she doesn ’ t have nerve enough to stand up for herself .
they
no , let them go .
they ’ re certainly a peaceful couple !
that since she ’ s mad herself , she ’ s married a madman .
neighbors and friends , though we don ’ t have anyone for the bride and bridegroom ’ s places at the table , you know there ’ s nothing missing in the feast itself .
she shall , lucentio .
come , gentlemen , let ’ s go in .
to hell with all worn-out horses , all crazy masters , and all bad roads .
was a man ever beaten as much as me ?
was a man ever as dirty as me ?
was a man ever so tired ?
i have been sent on ahead to light a fire , and they are coming after to warm themselves .
i ’ ll warm myself by blowing on the fire .
who calls so coldly ?
a piece of ice .
trust me , you could slide all the way from my shoulder to my heel taking no more of a running start than the distance between my head and my neck .
start the fire , good curtis .
are my master and his wife coming , grumio ?
yes , yes , curtis , so hurry up and start the fire .
leave out the water .
is she as fiery a shrew as they say ?
well she was , good curtis , before this frost .
your horn is a foot long , and i ’ m at least that size .
so tell me , grumio , how goes the world ?
therefore , do your duty and take your reward , because my master and mistress are nearly frozen to death .
the fire is ready .
so go on , tell me the news .
i think i ’ m getting delirious .
where ’ s the cook ?
is supper ready ?
are all the cups and glasses in their places , the tablecloths laid out — everything in order ?
for god ’ s sake , would someone bring me a mug of beer !
would your honor like to try this dried fruit ?
what garment would your honor like to wear today ?
i ’ m christopher sly .
everything ’ s ready .
so tell me what ’ s been going on .
well , first of all , my horse is tired and my master and mistress have had a falling out .
how ?
from their saddles into the dirt — but that ’ s another story .
well , let ’ s have it , grumio .
lean forward .
here .
there !
this is to feel the news , not hear it .
that ’ s what makes it “ sensitive ” news .
i was just knocking to see if anyone was home .
now , i ’ ll begin : first , we came down a steep hill , my master riding behind my mistress — both on one horse ?
what ’ s the difference ?
well , the difference of a horse !
it ’ s too bad .
yes — as you and the rest will find out as soon as he ’ s home .
but why am i telling you this ?
get them in here — nathaniel , joseph , nicholas , philip , walter , sugarsop , and the rest .
tell them to slick down their hair , brush their blue coats , and make sure their socks match .
have them click their heels together and don ’ t dare touch a hair of the master ’ s horse ’ s tail till they kiss their hands .
are they all ready ?
they are .
get them in here .
she already has a face .
yeah , so ?
you just said they had to face her .
i meant they had to give her credit .
she ’ s not going to borrow money from them .
welcome home , grumio .
what ’ s up , grumio ?
hey , grumio !
my man grumio !
so what ’ s the story , old boy ?
any minute .
where are those bastards ?
here , here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir !
here , sir ! ” you stupid , unpolished dolts !
where is the fool i sent on ahead ?
here , sir , as foolish as ever .
you unwashed farmworker !
you bastard workhorse drudge !
didn ’ t i tell you to meet me outside and bring these morons with you ?
nathaniel ’ s coat was being fixed , sir .
and walter couldn ’ t get his dagger out of its sheath .
only adam , rafe , and gregory were ready .
go , blockheads , go , and bring my supper to me .
where are my slippers ?
can we have some water please here ? — come and wash , kate , make yourself at home .
take it easy !
please !
it was just an accident !
will you say grace , sweet kate , or shall i ? — what is this ?
mutton ?
yes .
who brought it out here ?
i did .
you bastards !
where is that moron of a cook ?
how dare you serve it to me this way !
there , take it all back — plates , cups , the whole thing .
please , dear , calm down .
the meat was fine if you wanted to eat it .
and i ’ m telling you it was burnt and dried out .
come , i ’ ll show you your bridal chamber .
peter , did you ever see anything like it ?
he ’ s giving her a taste of her own medicine .
where is he ?
look out , he ’ s coming !
well , i ’ ve begun my reign with a carefully thought-out plan , and i have every hope of succeeding .
my falcon is now hungry and unfed and must not be given enough to eat until she comes to me , for if her hunger is satisfied , she ’ ll pay no attention to the bait .
i have another plan to make my bird come to me and recognize her owner ’ s call is to keep her from sleeping —
the way trainers do with young hawks that flutter and flap and will not obey .
she had no food today and will have none .
last night she got no sleep , and she won ’ t get any tonight .
just as i did with the meat , i ’ ll make up some problem with the way the bed is made , and throw the pillow one way and the cushion the other , and the blanket over here and the sheets over there .
and if she starts to drop off , i ’ ll rant and yell until i wake her up .
if anyone here knows a better way to tame a shrew , speak up , please .
it would be much appreciated .
what are you reading , teacher ?
answer me that first .
i hope you ’ re an expert in your field .
let me come clean .
i ’ m not really litio .
my name is hortensio , sir .
look how they kiss and carry on !
the hell with her !
look how she carries on with him !
it ’ s revolting !
well , to be on the safe side — so i don ’ t go back on my promise — i plan to get myself married to a wealthy widow within the next three days .
farewell , then , signior lucentio .
from now on , goodness in women , not superficial beauty , will win my heart .
what , are you trying to make me crazy ?
i ’ m christopher sly , son of old sly of barton-on-heath , a peddler by birth , a oh , this is why your poor wife is mourning !
and this is why your servants hang their heads in sorrow !
oh noble lord , consider your lineage .
look how your servants wait on you , each one ready to do whatever you command .
would you care to hear some music ?
listen !
do you want to sleep ?
we ’ ll have a couch made up that ’ s softer and more fragrant even than the bed of lustful
you ’ re busted .
hortensio and i have given you up .
you can ’ t mean it , tranio !
have you both really given me up ?
yes , ma 'am , we have .
so litio ’ s out of the picture .
he ’ s going after a young widow .
well , good for him !
yeah , and he ’ s going to tame her .
is that what he says ?
the taming school ?
is there such a place ?
master , master , i ’ ve been on the lookout so long , i ’ m ready to fall down dead — but i ’ ve got one , finally !
what does he look like , biondello ?
and what about him , tranio ?
go , take your sweetheart and leave him to me .
may god keep you well , sir .
this is it , for now .
mantua .
killed ?
why ?
that would be a little extreme !
it ’ s a capital offense for anyone from mantua to come to padua .
didn ’ t you know ?
it ’ s strange that you haven ’ t heard .
i have promissory notes from florence that i have to deliver .
oh yes , sir , i have often been to pisa — pisa , city of wise men .
oh sir , i accept .
and i ’ ll be eternally grateful to you .
no , no , i can ’ t , really .
the more i suffer , the more spiteful he becomes .
did he marry me just to starve me ?
and if they don ’ t find charity there , they find it someplace else .
but i , who have never known how to beg and never had to beg , am starved for food , dizzy with lack of sleep , kept awake with curses and fed with brawling .
and what irks me more than all these things put together is that he does it under the pretense of love — as though for me to eat or sleep would bring on fatal illness or sudden death .
what do you say to a calf ’ s foot ?
oh , lovely .
can i have some ?
i ’ m afraid it will i ’ d love it .
nice grumio , bring me some .
i don ’ t know .
i ’ m afraid it will make you too hot , too .
what do you say to a piece of beef with mustard ?
yes , but the mustard is probably too hot .
well then , the beef without the mustard .
absolutely not .
you ’ ll take the mustard or you ’ ll get no beef from grumio .
then both , or one , or anything you like .
how about the mustard without the beef .
get out of here , you measly , lying wretch .
cheer up .
give us a smile .
look , love , see how devoted i am ?
i am sure , sweet kate , this kindness deserves thanks .
what , not a word ?
i guess you don ’ t want it .
here , take away the dish .
please , leave it here .
thank you , sir .
come , mistress kate , i ’ ll join you .
now , tailor , let ’ s see what you ’ ve got .
lay out the gown .
what can i do for you , sir ?
here is the cap your worship ordered .
why , this was modeled on a porridge bowl !
no , definitely not !
it ’ s cheap and nasty !
it ’ s like a cockleshell or a walnut shell , a joke , a prank , a doll ’ s cap .
take it away .
bring me a bigger one .
i won ’ t have one any bigger .
when you are gentle , you shall have one , too , and not till then .
sir , i think i have the right to speak , and speak i certainly will .
i am not a child or an infant .
better men than you have heard me speak my mind , and if you can ’ t take it , then you ’ d better plug your ears .
you know , you ’ re right .
it ’ s a measly little cap , a dessert crust , a plaything , a silk pie .
i love you all the more for not liking it .
i don ’ t care if you love me or not , i like the cap and i ’ ll have it or i won ’ t have any .
now , your gown ?
yes , yes .
come , tailor , show it to us .
merciful god !
what do you call this ?
a sleeve ?
it ’ s like a cannon .
carved it up and down like an apple tart ?
snip and snip and cut and slash — it ’ s got more holes than a sieve !
what in the world do you call this , tailor !
you told me to make it well and properly and in keeping with the current style .
certainly , i did .
but if you remember , i didn ’ t tell you to parody the style .
i won ’ t take it .
do whatever you want with it .
i never saw a better-designed gown , more elegant and pleasing and well made .
yes , that ’ s it !
it ’ s a lie , you thread , you thimble , you measurement !
you flea , you louse , you winter cricket !
disrespected in my own house by a spool of thread !
i tell you , you ’ ve ruined her gown .
it ’ s not true .
the gown was made just as my master was directed .
grumio gave the order for how it should be done .
i gave him no order .
i gave him the material .
but how did you want it made ?
with a needle and thread .
but didn ’ t you expect us to cut the cloth ?
well , don ’ t face off with me .
you have bested many things , well don ’ t try and best me .
i will not be faced or bested .
i tell you i requested that your master cut out the gown , but i didn ’ t ask him to cut it all to pieces .
why , here is the order to prove it .
read it .
the note is a big fat liar if it says i said so .
do you like pictures ?
you have a noble wife who is much more beautiful than any other woman in this declining age .
before she began shedding tears all over her lovely face , she was the fairest creature in the world — and even now she has no equal .
i admit the cape .
i admit two sleeves .
ah , there ’ s the problem .
error in the bill , sir , error in the bill !
i ordered that the sleeves be cut out and sewed up again , and i ’ ll prove it in combat even if your little finger is armed with your thimble .
i am ready for you .
you take the bill and i ’ ll take your yardstick .
god have mercy , grumio !
he won ’ t have a chance .
well , sir , the gown is not for me .
you are right , it ’ s for my mistress .
go , take it away and let your master make whatever use of it he can .
certainly not !
take off my mistress ' gown for your master ’ s use !
why , what ’ s the problem ?
oh , sir , the problem goes far deeper than you realize .
take up my mistress ' gown for his master ’ s use !
oh , that ’ s disgusting !
ah well , my kate .
i mean , is the jay more precious than the lark because his feather is more beautiful ?
is the snake better than the eel because the pattern on his back pleases the eye ?
hardly , kate .
if you regard it as shameful , put the shame on me .
we ’ re off to eat and whoop it up at your father ’ s house .
i hate to say it , but it ’ s almost two and we won ’ t get there before suppertime .
it shall be seven o 'clock before i get on my horse .
whatever i say , or think , or do , you ’ re continually contradicting it .
sirs , never mind .
we won ’ t go today — or any day until it ’ s clear that it shall be whatever time i say it is .
yes , certainly .
unless i am mistaken , signior baptista may remember me from the pegasus in genoa , where we both stayed twenty years ago .
of course i will .
but , sir , here comes your servant .
don ’ t worry about me .
i told him that your father was in venice , and that you expected him to arrive in padua today .
he gives biondello here comes baptista .
places , everyone !
signior baptista , i ’ m glad to see you . — sir , this is the gentleman i told you of .
i hope you ’ ll be a good father to me now .
give me bianca for my inheritance .
sir , pardon me for what i am about to say .
i appreciate your frankness and your brevity .
it ’ s true that your son lucentio here loves my daughter , and she loves him — or else they ’ re putting on quite an act .
your son will have my consent to marry my daughter .
not in my house , lucentio .
my servants might overhear , and old gremio is still hanging around , so we might be interrupted .
i hope with all my heart she will !
cambio .
what is it , biondello ?
you saw my master wink and laugh at you ?
what about it ?
please , educate me .
he ’ s talking with the bogus father about the bogus son .
and so — ?
you are to bring his daughter to the supper .
and then ?
the old priest at saint luke ’ s church is at your command at all hours .
and what of all this ?
i don ’ t know , except they are busy with some phony guarantee .
so go and put your stamp on the girl .
go to the church : take the priest , the clerk , and some reasonably honest witnesses .
if this isn ’ t what you ’ ve been hoping for , i have no more to say except that you ought to say goodbye to bianca forever .
i knew a girl who was married in an afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to stuff a rabbit .
farewell , sir .
my master has instructed me to go to saint luke ’ s to tell the priest to be ready in case you should show up with your better half .
she will be pleased .
then why am i worried ?
it will be hard if “ cambio ” loses her .
come , let ’ s continue on toward your father ’ s house .
good lord , how bright and splendid is the moon tonight !
the moon ?
you mean the sun !
it is not nighttime now .
i say it ’ s the moon that shines so bright .
i know it ’ s the sun that shines so bright .
now , by my mother ’ s son , and that ’ s me , it will be moon or star or whatever i want before i ’ ll travel to your father ’ s house .
i say it ’ s the moon .
i know it ’ s the moon .
well , you ’ re a liar , then .
it ’ s the blessed sun .
then god be praised , it petruchio , do whatever you like .
you ’ ve won .
well , onward , then .
that ’ s how things should be — straight and smooth .
but , hang on !
i hear someone coming .
young budding virgin , fair and pure and sweet , where are you off to ?
your parents are lucky to have such a lovely child .
is would your mightiness care to wash his hands ?
we ’ re overjoyed to see you sane again .
if only you had a clearer memory of who you are !
these past fifteen years you have been living in a dream , and even when you were awake , it was as though you slept .
fifteen years !
that ’ s some nap .
but i never spoke the whole time ?
oh yes , you spoke , my lord , but total nonsense .
why , dear me , kate !
i hope you haven ’ t lost your mind .
this is not a maiden , as you say , but an old man — wrinkled , faded , and withered .
what is his name ?
lucentio , sir .
a fortunate coincidence — more fortunate for your son .
the sister of my wife , this lady here , is married to your son .
and there ’ s no need for wonder or worry .
let me embrace the father of lucentio , and then we ’ ll journey on to see your son , who will rejoice at your arrival .
i assure you , sir , it ’ s true .
well , petruchio , all this is very encouraging .
the priest is already there .
we ’ re off , biondello .
i ’ ll see them safely married first and then hurry back to my master ’ s .
i wonder why cambio hasn ’ t shown up in all this time .
here is the door , sir .
this is lucentio ’ s house .
my father-in-law lives closer to the marketplace .
that ’ s where i ’ m going now , so i ’ ll leave you here .
you must not go without having a drink first .
they ’ re pretty busy in there .
you ’ d better knock louder .
is signior lucentio at home , sir ?
what if a fellow were bringing him a couple of hundred pounds to toss around ?
i believe i have some choice in the matter , sir .
come here , you wretch !
what , have you forgotten me ?
forgotten you !
no , sir .
i could not forget you , since i never saw you before in my life .
my honorable , reverend master ?
yes , of course .
there he is at the window .
is that so ?
help , help , help !
this madman will murder me .
how dare i ?
how dare what , is the man crazy ?
your father !
why , you scoundrel !
your father is a sailmaker in bergamo .
you ’ re wrong , sir , very wrong .
why , what do you imagine his name to be ?
his name !
lucentio !
oh god , he ’ s murdered his master !
oh , my son , my son !
tell me , you monster , where is my son lucentio ?
take this mad wretch to jail . — father-in-law baptista , will you see that he ’ s available to appear in court ?
take me off to jail ?
he mustn ’ t go to prison .
be quiet , signior gremio .
i say he shall go to prison .
be careful , signior baptista , lest you be made the dupe in this business .
i could swear this is the real vincentio .
well , no , not literally .
no , i know that you ’ re signior lucentio .
away with the doddering fool !
take him off to jail !
we ’ re ruined !
there he is !
pardon , dear father .
dear son , you ’ re alive !
pardon us , dear father .
what have you done ?
where is lucentio ?
i have made your daughter mine by marriage while false impressions blinded your eyes .
we ’ ve all been duped .
where is that damned wretch , tranio , who defied me in such a disgraceful manner ?
say , isn ’ t this the latin master cambio ?
cambio is transformed into lucentio .
it was love that performed these miracles .
bianca ’ s love made me trade places with tranio while he masqueraded as me around town .
what tranio did , he did at my command .
so pardon him , dear father , for my sake .
no , i ’ ll slit the nose of the villain who would have sent me to jail .
but sir , have you married my daughter without my consent ?
don ’ t worry , baptista , you ’ ll be perfectly satisfied .
you ’ ll see .
all i can hope for now is a share of the feast .
let ’ s follow them to see how this turns out .
first kiss me , kate , and then we will .
what , here in the middle of the street ?
are you ashamed of me ?
but i ’ m ashamed to kiss , sir .
all right then , back home we go .
no , wait .
i isn ’ t this good ?
come , my sweet kate .
better late than never — and it ’ s never too late to change .
well , thank god i ’ m cured !
amen .
i thank you all .
you won ’ t regret this .
how is my noble lord ?
this is all quite pleasant .
where is my wife ?
here , noble lord .
what is your wish with regard to her ?
you call yourself my wife , yet you don ’ t call me “ husband ” ?
it ’ s my men who should call me “ lord . ” i ’ m your man , your fellow .
my fair bianca , bid my father welcome , while i with equal affection welcome yours .
this last course here is for closing up the stomach after great feasting .
now everyone be seated , as this is the part where we sit and chat as well as eat .
all we do is sit and sit and eat and eat .
i wish that were true for both our sakes !
that ’ s very sensible , but you missed my sense : i meant hortensio is afraid of you .
he who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning .
a very candid reply .
what ’ s that supposed to mean ?
that ’ s what i conceive of him .
nice save !
kiss him for that , good widow .
he who is dizzy thinks the world is spinning ” — please , tell me what you meant by that .
your husband , being saddled with a shrew , projects his own suffering onto my husband .
and now you know my meaning .
a very nasty meaning .
my meaning and i
you tell her , widow !
i ’ ll bet you a hundred marks , my kate puts her flat on her back .
well , that ’ s really my job .
well said !
here ’ s to you !
what do you think of these quick-witted folks , gremio ?
they certainly do like to butt heads !
yes , but not out of fear .
i ’ ll go back to sleep now .
no , you shall not .
i ’ ll
well , she got away .
signior tranio , you also took aim at that bird , though you didn ’ t hit her . — so here ’ s a health to all who ’ ve shot and missed .
a witty if a cynical reply .
it ’ s good you hunted for yourself , sir .
tranio got you that time .
i thank you for that quip , good tranio .
he ’ s made me a little sore , i ’ ll admit .
but since the gibe glanced off me , ten to one it hit you both straight on .
seriously , though , son petruchio , i think you have the most thoroughgoing shrew of us all .
well , i disagree .
agreed .
what ’ s the bet ?
twenty crowns .
twenty crowns ?
i ’ d wager twenty times as much on my wife .
a hundred then .
agreed .
good !
it ’ s a bet .
who should begin ?
i will .
biondello , go and tell your mistress to come to me .
here i go .
son , i ’ ll stake you half that bianca comes .
i ’ ll have no halves .
what !
she ’ s busy and cannot come ! ” is that an answer ?
yes , and a nice one at that .
pray god your wife doesn ’ t send you a worse one .
i ’ m hoping for better .
so , where ’ s my wife ?
she says she thinks this is a prank .
she will not come .
she says that you should come to her .
worse and worse !
she i can guess her answer .
what ?
she will not .
by all that ’ s holy , here comes katherina !
you sent for me , sir ?
where are your sister and hortensio ’ s wife ?
they sit chatting by the parlor fire .
go bring them here .
if they refuse to come , get physical — use a whip if you have to , but get them out here to their husbands .
this is a miracle , if you talk of miracles .
it is .
i wonder what it means .
it means peace and love and a quiet life , supremacy based on reverence and profound respect , and — not to go on and on about it — everything that ’ s sweet and happy .
may good fortune come to you , good petruchio !
you ’ ve won the wager , and i will add twenty thousand crowns to what they owe you .
look , here she comes , with your ungovernable wives in tow , like prisoners of her womanly persuasion . — katherine , that cap of yours doesn ’ t look good on you .
take it off and throw it on the ground .
lord , may i never see a day of trouble until the day i let someone treat me like that .
for shame !
what kind of loyalty is this ?
i wish your loyalty were as foolish .
the wisdom of your loyalty , fair bianca , has cost me a hundred crowns since dinner .
the more fool you for betting on my loyalty .
there will be no lecture .
she shall not .
i say she shall . — and first begin with her .
girls , girls !
this disrespectful stance toward the man who is your lord , your king , your governor tarnishes your beauty the way the frosts of winter blights the land .
a woman owes her husband the same loyalty a subject owes his king .
and when she is peevish and perverse , sullen , sour , and disobedient to his honest wishes , what is she but a loathsome , warlike rebel and an ungrateful traitor to her loving lord ?
i am ashamed that women are so foolish as to declare war when they should plead on their knees for peace , that they seek authority , supremacy , and power when they are under an obligation to serve , love , and obey .
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unfit for toil and trouble in the world , if not so that our soft qualities and our hearts should agree with our external parts ?
come , come , you weak , ungovernable worms !
my spirit has been as proud as each of yours , my courage as great , and my reason perhaps even better suited to bandy words back and forth and exchange frown for frown .
but now i see our weapons are like straws , our strength like a straw ’ s weakness , and our weakness past comparison , so that we seem to be the thing we most are not .
come on and kiss me , kate .
it ’ s nice to see children playing well together .
but not so nice when women misbehave .
come , kate , let ’ s go to bed .
we three are married , but you two are defeated .
it ’ s amazing , if i may say so , that she let herself be tamed .
madam wife , they say i ’ ve been dreaming or asleep for more than fifteen years .
yes , and it seemed twice as long to me , having been kept from your bed that whole time .
that ’ s too long . — servants , leave her and me alone .
now , madam , undress and come to bed .
thrice noble lord , i beg you to excuse me for another night or two — or at least until nightfall .
your doctors have expressly forbidden me to sleep with you , as there ’ s a risk that you might have a relapse .
i hope this explanation will stand as my excuse .
i ’ m not sure i can wait that long .
still , i ’ d hate to see my former dreams return .
so i your honor ’ s actors , hearing of your recovery , have come to perform a pleasing comedy for you — and your doctors approve wholeheartedly .
so they think it ’ s a good idea for you to watch a play and direct your thoughts toward laughter and merriment — two strong preventive medicines that foster long life .
okay , bring on the play .
what , like stuff from a house ?
no , it ’ s a story .
well , let ’ s watch it .
we ’ re not getting any younger .
i was born in pisa , famous for its serious citizens , like my father before me ; my father , vincentio , a successful , world-traveled merchant , was one of the
i ’ ll fix you , i swear .
you thug !
read your history !
we you won ’ t pay for the glasses you smashed ?
no , not a penny .
get out of my face .
go play with yourself .
i know my rights .
i ’ m not moving an inch , pal .
let them come — i don ’ t care .
that ’ s good advice .
wait !
who are all these people ?
maybe it ’ s a parade to welcome us to town , master .
don ’ t worry , i couldn ’ t care less .
the only possible interest i could take in you would be to hit you on the head with a stool , paint your face with blood , and make a fool out of you .
may the good lord keep me safe from all women like her !
me too , lord !
what a spoiled little brat .
sister , be happy in my unhappiness . — sir , i will humbly obey you .
i ’ ll take comfort in my books and music , reading and practicing my instruments .
listen tranio !
that ’ s signior baptista , will you really be this cruel ?
why are you locking her away because of this fiend from hell , signor baptista ?
and because i know how fond she is of music , playing her instruments , and poetry , i plan to hire live-in tutors for her .
katherina , you may stay .
i don ’ t think so !
am i to be dictated to , like a child ?
you can go straight to hell !
so long .
that is , if we ever want to return to being rivals for bianca ’ s love .
and that would be — ?
to find a husband for her sister .
a husband ?
you mean a devil !
i mean a husband .
i say a devil .
do you really think there ’ s a man fool enough to marry into hell — however rich the father is ?
oh , i don ’ t know .
guys who ’ d take her with all her faults , provided there were enough money involved .
i don ’ t know .
what do you say , signior gremio ?
this imaginary suitor for katherina — i ’ d buy him the best horse in padua if he ’ d get here quickly , woo her , marry her , take her to bed , and rid the house of her .
let ’ s go .
sir , is it possible that a person could fall in love so suddenly ?
oh , tranio , until it happened to me , i never would have thought it possible .
the heart won ’ t be reasoned with .
if love has touched you , love has touched you — end of story .
yes , you ’ re right .
please go on .
i feel better already , and i know there ’ s more good advice where that came from .
master , you were so focused on the girl herself , i wonder if you missed the main point here .
oh no !
tranio , i saw her coral-pink lips move and perfume the air with her breath .
oh , tranio , what a cruel father he is .
still , did you notice how ready he was to hire good tutors for her ?
i did — and now i ’ ve got it !
tranio , i think i ’ ve got it !
i ’ ll bet we ’ re both thinking the same thing , master .
tell me your idea first .
you will pretend to be a schoolmaster and offer to teach the girl .
it is .
do you think it would work ?
no , not a chance .
enough !
it ’ s obvious : here comes biondello .
where have you been , boy ?
where have come here , boy .
it ’ s no time for jokes : sober up .
understand ?
of course , sir .
and you ’ re not to utter a syllable of tranio ’ s name .
wish i could say the same .
i ’ d second your wish if it automatically meant that lucentio could have baptista ’ s youngest daughter .
this is for your master ’ s sake , not mine .
when we ’ re by ourselves you can call me “ tranio . ” everywhere else , address me as your master lucentio .
tranio , let ’ s go .
one last thing , and this is up to you .
you ’ ll have to woo bianca like the rest .
don ’ t ask why .
no , no .
very impressive .
is there any more , or is that it ?
and what an excellent piece of work it is , too , madam lady !
i wish it were over .
huntsman , look after my hounds .
let merriman catch his breath — the poor dog ’ s foaming at the mouth .
i think belman is just as good , my lord .
i swear he ’ s the better dog .
you ’ re a fool .
if echo were as fast , he would be worth a dozen like belman .
but give them all a good dinner and look after them well .
i ’ ll go hunting again tomorrow , i think .
i will , my lord .
what ’ s this ?
a drunkard or a corpse ?
check and see if he ’ s breathing .
he is , my lord .
but this would be too cold a place to sleep if he hadn ’ t warmed himself with ale .
alas , grim death , how vile and ugly your near-twin , sleep , is !
what do you think ?
i ’ m off to visit my friends in padua — particularly my best friend hortensio .
and i think this is his house .
here , you there , grumio .
knock .
knock , sir ?
whom should i knock ?
has anyone offended your worship ?
moron !
i ’ m telling you to make a fist and pound .
my master is being difficult .
say , what ’ s the trouble ?
if it isn ’ t my old friend grumio — and my dear friend petruchio !
how ’ s everyone in verona ?
hortensio , have you come to break up the fight ?
i don ’ t care what he told you in latin .
i told him to knock at your gate and for the life of me could not get him to do it .
knock at the gate ?
oh , for pete ’ s sake !
didn ’ t you clearly say “ knock , ” “ pound , ” and “ put your fists to work ” ?
now you say it was “ knock at the gate ” ?
i ’ m warning you .
easy , petruchio .
i ’ ll vouch for grumio .
now , my dear friend , what lucky wind blows you in from verona ?
the wind that scatters young men throughout the world , encouraging them to seek their fortunes some place other than home , where there ’ s little to be found in the way of experience .
i have money in my purse and property at home , so i ’ m off to see the world .
i doubt you ’ d thank me in the end , but she ’ s rich , all right , very rich .
but you ’ re too good a friend for me to wish her on you .
hortensio , good friends like us can get by on a few words .
i can help you find a wife who ’ s rich , young , beautiful , and reared in a manner fit for a gentlewoman .
hush , hortensio .
you don ’ t know what money can buy .
her father is baptista minola , a pleasant and courteous gentleman .
her name is katherina minola , famous throughout padua for her scolding tongue .
i don ’ t know her , but i know her father and he knew mine well .
i won ’ t sleep until i see her , hortensio .
wait , petruchio , i should go with you .
katherine the shrew ! ” that ’ s the worst thing you can call a young woman .
i ’ ll disguise myself in somber robes .
oh , master , master , look !
who are these people ?
hush , grumio .
it is my rival for bianca .
petruchio , let ’ s stand over here awhile .
oh , what an excellent thing this learning is !
good to see you , signior hortensio .
do you know where i ’ m going ?
to baptista minola ’ s house .
that ’ s great .
and i have met a gentleman who promises to help me find a good music tutor to instruct our lady love .
gremio , this is no time to compete over how deeply we love bianca .
that ’ s good , if he ’ ll really do it .
have you told him all her faults , hortensio ?
i know she is a hateful , brawling scold .
if that ’ s all , gentlemen , i see no problem .
no ?
tell me , friend .
where are you from ?
my father ’ s dead , and his fortune is mine now .
i hope to see good days — and many of them .
sir , such a life with such a wife is unlikely !
but if you have the stomach for it , you ’ ll have all the help from me you need .
do you really mean to go after this wildcat ?
why did i come here if not for that ?
i , who have survived storms at sea where the winds raged like wild animals ?
i , who have heard the rumble of guns in battle — and thunder in the sky ( heaven ’ s version of artillery ) .
listen , hortensio .
absolutely — so long as he gets the girl .
i wish i could be as certain of a good dinner .
is that the man you want ?
but not the woman who scolds , anyway , i hope .
sir , a word before you go .
are you a suitor to the girl we speak of , yes or no ?
what if i am ?
not if you go away , there isn ’ t .
because , if you must know , she ’ s been chosen by signior gremio .
because she ’ s been chosen by signior hortensio .
wait a minute , gentlemen .
be good enough to hear me out .
baptista is a noble gentleman — one to whom my father is not completely unknown — and lovely as his daughter is , she is entitled to any number of suitors — myself among them .
i don ’ t think he ’ d have any choice , my lord .
when he woke , he wouldn ’ t know where he was .
it would be just like a nice daydream or fantasy .
well , take him on up and we ’ ll try to pull it off .
carry him to my best room — gently , so he doesn ’ t wake — and hang all my erotic paintings around him .
bathe his filthy head with warm , scented water .
convince him that he has been out of his mind — and when he says he ’ s out of his mind my lord , i promise we will play our parts so skillfully that he will believe everything we tell him .
the beautiful helen of troy had a thousand suitors .
this fellow will out-talk us all .
hortensio , what ’ s all this about ?
yes , leave that labor to great hercules — it ’ s worse than the previous twelve put together .
sir , that ’ s well said and well thought out .
an excellent motion .
let ’ s go .
i second that
dear sister , it ’ s unfair to me — and unfair to yourself — to turn me into a slave .
that i won ’ t stand for .
and don ’ t lie .
you lying brat .
it ’ s hortensio , isn ’ t it ?
oh , i see .
you ’ ll live in luxury with gremio .
is it because of
what , in my presence ?
you mean you don ’ t even want to hear my side ?
don ’ t talk to me .
now what ?
good morning , neighbor baptista .
good morning , neighbor gremio .
and to you , good sir .
tell me , don ’ t you have a virtuous and lovely daughter named katherina ?
i have a daughter named katherina , sir .
please , signior gremio .
you and he are both welcome , sir .
as for my daughter katherine , this much i know : she ’ s not for you — more ’ s the pity .
i see you don ’ t intend to part with her — or perhaps you don ’ t like my company .
don ’ t misunderstand me , sir .
i ’ m just stating the facts as i see them .
where are you from ?
what ’ s your name ?
my name is petruchio , son of antonio , a man well known throughout italy .
i know him well .
you are welcome for his sake .
you ’ re forgive me , signior gremio , but i ’ m anxious to get things moving .
no doubt , but you may be going about it the wrong way — neighbor , this gift is very gracious , i ’ m sure .
i myself , who am more indebted to you than anyone , have brought you this young scholar
many thanks , signior gremio .
welcome , good cambio .
your name is lucentio , you say .
of what city , may i ask ?
a man of great influence .
i know him well by reputation .
you are very welcome here , sir .
let ’ s take a little walk in the orchard before dinner .
you are all most welcome here ; please make yourselves at home .
signior baptista , i ’ m actually in a bit of a hurry .
you knew my father well ; therefore , you know me , the sole heir to all his property and possessions , which i have added to rather than depleted .
so , tell me , assuming i win your daughter ’ s love , what dowry would she bring to the marriage ?
twenty thousand crowns now , and half my lands after my death .
let ’ s have explicit contracts drawn up to ensure that both sides keep their promises .
that counts for everything .
oh , that ’ s nothing , believe me , sir .
i ’ m as commanding as she is proud , and when two raging fires meet , they end up consuming the very thing that kindled them .
i ’ m that great gust to her fire .
well , good luck !
but prepare yourself for some unpleasantness .
mountains don ’ t tremble , however much the wind may blow !
why so pale , my friend ?
will my daughter be a good musician , do you think ?
i think she ’ ll be a better soldier .
you don ’ t think you can teach her ?
i ’ ll give you frets ! ” with that , she clobbers me with the lute so that my head goes right through ,
i like this girl !
now i want her more than ever .
i can ’ t wait to meet her !
please do .
i ’ ll wait for her here and when she comes i ’ ll take a novel approach with her .
if she rants , i ’ ll tell her that she sings as sweetly as a nightingale .
if she glares , i ’ ll say her brow is as clear as roses newly washed with morning dew .
if she is silent and won ’ t speak at all , i ’ ll praise her chattiness and say she speaks with piercing eloquence .
if she orders me to go , i ’ ll thank her warmly as if she ’ d just offered to put me up for a week .
if she refuses my proposal , i ’ ll tell her how much i ’ m looking forward to the announcement and the wedding .
carry him gently to bed , and every man be ready at his post when he awakes .
go , lad , and find out what the trumpet ’ s sounding for .
it ’ s probably some noble gentleman stopping off in mid-journey , thinking to spend the night here .
sir , it ’ s a troupe of actors who want to perform for your lordship .
have them come in .
you are welcome here , my friends .
we thank your honor .
were you thinking of spending the night here ?
yes , if that would be all right with your lordship .
by all means .
i remember this fellow — he once played the eldest son of a farmer .
it was the play in which you wooed the gentlewoman so successfully .
i have forgotten your name , but you were well cast in the role and played it convincingly .
good morning , kate , for i hear that ’ s what you ’ re called .
is that what you ’ ve heard ?
driven ? ” really ?
i had you figured for a piece of furniture .
what do you mean by “ furniture ” ?
a nice stool .
you ’ re right , actually .
come sit on me .
asses are made for bearing , and so are you .
women are made for
not by the likes of you !
i know how too light for a lout like you to catch — though no lighter than i should be .
should be ?
if i ’ m a wasp , look out for my stinger .
all i have to do is remove it .
true , if a fool such as yourself could find it .
everyone knows where a wasp wears its stinger .
in its tail .
no , in its tongue .
whose tongue ?
yours , if we ’ re talking about i ’ m leaving .
you ’ re leaving with my tongue in your tail ?
no , come back , kate .
we ’ ll see about that !
i swear i ’ ll smack you if you hit me again .
not if you want to keep your arms !
it has no fighting spirit .
oh , come on now , kate .
don ’ t look so sour .
that ’ s my way , when i see a crab-apple .
there ’ s no crab-apple here , so don ’ t look sour .
there is a crab-apple here .
show me .
i would , if i had a mirror .
what , you mean my face looks like a crab-apple ?
you know , you ’ re right .
i probably am too young for you .
maybe , but you ’ re wrinkled all the same .
oh , that ’ s with worry .
well , that doesn ’ t worry me .
let me go .
no , not a bit .
i find you quite gentle .
i was told that you were violent , proud , and sullen .
you haven ’ t got it in you to frown or look displeased or bite your lip as angry women do .
no , you entertain your suitors with mild and gentle conversation , quiet and pleasant .
why does the world report that kate is lame ?
the world ’ s a liar .
kate is as straight and slender as a hazel-twig , her hair as brown as hazelnut shells , and she herself sweeter than the kernels .
take a few steps — i want to see you walk .
did diana ever beautify a grove as much as kate beautifies this room with her queenly movements ?
it ’ s born of my a witty mother !
too bad about the son !
am i not wise ?
i ’ m the man who was born to tame you and change you from a wildcat kate into a kate as gentle and domestic as other household kates .
i almost recognize that voice .
it ’ s — but he ’ s drowned , and these guys are devils .
oh , god help me !
four legs and two voices — a very special monster .
one voice speaks well and talks about his friend .
the other voice is harsh and abusive .
if it takes all the wine in my bottle , i ’ ll cure him .
come on .
caliban stephano !
is your other mouth calling my name ?
mercy , mercy !
this isn ’ t a monster , it ’ s a devil .
i ’ ll leave him alone .
i have no interest in getting mixed up with the devil .
stephano !
if you ’ re stephano , touch me and speak to me .
i ’ m trinculo — don ’ t be scared — your good friend trinculo .
if you ’ re trinculo , then come out .
i ’ ll pull on these smaller legs .
if any legs here are trinculo ’ s , these are .
but aren ’ t you drowned , stephano ?
i hope you ’ re not drowned .
has the storm passed ?
i hid under this monster ’ s cloak to get out of the storm .
are you really alive , stephano ?
oh , stephano , two men from naples survived !
please stop turning me around .
my stomach ’ s a little upset .
i swam ashore like a duck .
i can swim like a duck , i swear .
here ,
oh stephano , do you have any more of that wine ?
i ’ ve got the whole barrel , man .
you come from heaven , don ’ t you ?
no , from the moon , i ’ m telling you .
i used to be the man in the moon a long time ago .
my mistress showed me you in the moon and your dog and your bush .
i can ’ t believe i was scared of him !
a pretty pathetic monster .
the man in the moon !
what a poor , gullible monster . — that was a nice big gulp , monster !
what a lying , drunken monster .
when his god falls asleep , the monster will snatch his wine bottle .
come on , then .
get down and swear it .
i ’ m going to laugh myself to death over this silly monster .
a rotten , foolish monster .
i could find it in my heart to beat him — come on , kiss my feet .
an awful monster !
i ’ ll show you where to get fresh water .
i ’ ll pick berries for you .
i ’ ll fish for you and get you plenty of firewood .
the tyrant i ’ m serving now can go to hell !
what a silly monster , to think a poor drunk is wonderful .
a loud-mouthed , drunken monster .
good monster !
show us the way .
right now i ’ d give a thousand
some kinds of lowly activities are done for noble reasons .
and you can do poor things that lead to rich results .
this hard work would be boring and nasty to me , but i ’ m working for a mistress who makes me enjoy my labor .
oh , she ’ s ten times nicer than her father is mean , and he ’ s the height of crabbiness .
i have thousands of logs to take away and pile up , on strict orders from him .
my sweet darling cries when she sees me work and tells me that such a wonderful man never performed such lowly tasks before .
these sweet thoughts relieve me and refresh me , especially when i ’ m slaving away busily .
now , please , i beg you , don ’ t work so hard .
i wish the lightning had burned up all those logs that you ’ ve been ordered to stack !
please put that log down and rest a while .
when this wood burns , it ’ ll weep for making you tired .
my father ’ s studying hard , so he won ’ t see you .
so please rest .
we ’ re safe from my father for at least three hours .
oh , my dear mistress , i won ’ t be able to finish this work until sunset at the earliest .
if you sit down , i ’ ll carry your logs a while .
please give me that .
i ’ ll take it over to the pile .
i ’ d be as right for the job as you are , and i ’ d do it more easily , since i ’ d have good will on my side .
you look tired .
i beg you to tell me your name so i can use it in my prayers .
miranda . — oh father , i ’ ve disobeyed you by telling him that !
i ’ ve looked at many ladies with pleasure , and been
but with you it ’ s different .
you ’ re perfect , without a rival in the world , made up of the best qualities of every creature .
i ’ ve never known any woman or seen a woman ’ s face — except my own in the mirror .
and i ’ ve never met any men besides you and my father .
i ’ m a prince by birth , miranda — maybe even a king now ; though i wish i weren ’ t — and normally i wouldn ’ t put up with carrying these logs any more than i ’ d let flies breed in my mouth .
but i ’ ll tell you something from my soul .
the second i saw you , my heart rushed to serve you and be your slave , so here i am now , a patient log-man .
do you love me ?
oh heaven , oh earth , witness what i ’ m about to say , and reward me if i tell the truth !
if i ’ m lying , then
more than anything else in the world , i love you , value you , and honor you .
look at me crying — what a fool i am to cry at what makes me happy .
why are you crying ?
i ’ m crying at how unworthy i am to give you what i want to give you and to take what i ’ m dying to have .
the more i try to hide what i ’ m feeling , the bigger it gets .
i ’ ll be your wife if you ’ ll have me .
otherwise , i ’ ll die a virgin , devoted to you .
you can refuse to make me your spouse , but i ’ ll be your servant whether you want me to or not .
you ’ ll be my wife , dearest , and i ’ ll serve you forever .
will you be my husband , then ?
a million goodbyes to you .
now it ’ s time to get back to my studying , since i have a lot of serious business to take care of before dinner .
don ’ t tell me that .
when the barrel ’ s empty , we ’ ll drink water .
not one drop sooner .
therefore , drink up . — servant-monster , drink a toast to me .
servant monster ” ?
what a crazy island this is .
they say there are only five people on it .
we ’ re three of them .
if the other two are as loopy as we are , our country ’ s in bad shape .
drink when i order you , servant-monster .
your eyes look like they ’ ve sunk into your head .
where else should his eyes be , if not in his head ?
he ’ d be quite a monster if his eyes were in his tail .
my man — monster is so drunk he can ’ t talk .
he ’ s not standing straight enough to hold a flag .
we ’ re not going to run in our army , monsieur monster .
or walk either .
you ’ ll just lie there like sleeping dogs and say nothing .
monster sweetie , be a good monster and just speak once .
how is your highness ?
let me lick your shoe .
lord , ” he calls you ?
what an idiot that monster is !
trinculo , speak politely .
if you mutiny against me , i ’ ll hang you from the next tree .
thank you , my noble lord .
now would you please listen once again to the request i made to you earlier ?
i ’ ll stand , and so will trinculo .
you lie .
trinculo , if you interrupt him any more , i swear i ’ ll knock some teeth out of your head .
i didn ’ t say anything .
okay , just stay quiet .
go on .
i was telling you he used witchcraft to take this island .
he stole it from me .
if your highness is willing , take revenge on him for that — because i know you ’ re brave enough , i don ’ t dare to — that ’ s for sure .
you ’ ll be lord of the island then , and i ’ ll be your servant .
and how would we go about doing that ?
can you bring me to him ?
yes , yes , my lord .
i ’ ll take you to where he sleeps , and you can pound a nail into his head .
you lie .
you can ’ t do that .
what an idiot this guy is ! — you ’ re a rotten piece of work ! — i beg your highness , beat him up and take his wine bottle from him .
when he loses that , he ’ ll be drinking salt water , since i ’ ll never tell him where the freshwater springs are .
trinculo , watch out .
if you interrupt this monster with one more word , i ’ ll beat you like a piece of salted fish .
what did i do ?
i didn ’ t do anything .
i need to get away from you .
didn ’ t you call him a liar ?
you lie .
i didn ’ t accuse you of lying .
are you out of your mind and deaf too ?
damn your wine !
ha , ha , ha !
now go ahead and tell me the rest of your story . — please go stand farther away .
beat him up .
after a little while , i ’ ll beat him too .
just as i told you , he usually sleeps in the afternoon .
at that time you can smash in his skull after seizing his books ; or you can bash his skull with a log ; or you can stab him in the belly ; or cut his windpipe .
just remember to grab his books first , since without them he ’ s just a poor fool like me , and can ’ t command a single spirit .
all the spirits hate him as much as i do .
be sure to burn his magic books .
he has some wonderful home furnishings — that ’ s what he calls them — that he ’ ll use to decorate his house when he gets one .
the most important thing for you to think about is how beautiful his daughter is .
he says she has no equal .
i never saw a woman except her and sycorax , my mother .
but miranda is so much more beautiful , you can ’ t even compare the two .
is she really that wonderful ?
yes , my lord .
monster , i ’ ll kill this man .
his daughter and i will be king and queen — god protect us ! — and you and trinculo will be our governors . — do you like that idea , trinculo ?
excellent .
give me your hand .
i ’ m sorry i hit you .
but try to control your speech .
in a half an hour he ’ ll be asleep .
will you kill him then ?
dear father , if you caused this terrible storm with your magic powers , please put an end to it .
the sky ’ s so dark it looks like it would rain down boiling hot tar if the sea weren ’ t swelling up to the sky to put its fire out .
oh , i suffered along with all the men i watched suffer !
a fine ship , with some good people in it , i ’ m sure , smashed to pieces .
their dying shouts broke my heart !
the poor people died .
if i ’ d been a god i would ’ ve let the sea sink inside the earth before it had a chance to swallow up that ship and all the people it was carrying .
calm down .
there ’ s nothing to get upset about .
no harm was done .
oh , what a horrible day !
there was no harm , i ’ m telling you .
it never occurred to me to imagine there was anything more to know .
yes , i swear .
you make me so happy .
i ’ m full of joy .
let ’ s be light-hearted .
i ’ ll do anything you ask , monster , anything reasonable . — come on , trinculo , let ’ s sing .
that ’ s not the tune i had in mind .
what ’ s this song ?
oh , forgive all my sins !
are you scared ?
no , monster , not me .
don ’ t be scared .
this ’ ll be a wonderful kingdom to live in , where they play music for free .
as soon as you kill prospero .
that ’ ll happen soon enough .
i remember the plan .
the sound is going away .
but let ’ s follow it , and then do our dirty work afterward .
lead us , monster ; we ’ ll follow .
i wish i could see this invisible drummer .
he really plays well .
are you coming monster ?
my old bones are tired .
we ’ re wandering in a maze .
if you don ’ t mind , i need to rest a bit .
i can ’ t blame you , old lord .
sit down and rest .
we ’ re searching on land , but he ’ s lost in the sea .
we have to give up and let him go .
what ’ s that music ?
my friends , listen .
what marvelous music !
heaven help us !
what were those things ?
now i ’ ll believe that unicorns exist , and that there ’ s a tree in arabia where the phoenix lives .
travelers have never told lies , no matter what the fools at home accuse them of .
if i told them about this back in naples , would they believe me ?
they vanished strangely .
it ’ s all right , since they left their food behind , and we ’ re hungry .
would you like to taste the banquet ?
not me .
i assure you , sir , there ’ s nothing to be afraid of .
brother , duke , please have some food .
oh , it ’ s horrible , horrible .
i thought the clouds were talking to me , the winds were singing to me , and the thunder , like an awful organ pipe , roared prospero ’ s name .
it sang about my crimes .
i ’ ll go join him there , going down deeper than any anchor ever sank , and lie with him dead in the mud .
i ’ ll fight every one of these devils if i have to , one at a time .
i ’ ll back you up .
all three of them are crazy with despair .
their guilt is finally starting to gnaw at them , like a slow-acting poison .
those of you who are young and active , i beg you to follow them and keep them from doing the crazy things their guilt might push them to do .
follow them , please .
you ’ ve said it well .
so have a seat and talk to her .
she ’ s yours . — come , ariel !
my trusty servant , ariel !
what does my powerful master wish for ?
i ’ m here .
you and your fellow spirits did your last assignment well , and now i need your help again .
go bring them all here ; i give you power over them .
i ’ ve promised them i would , and they ’ re expecting it .
right now ?
yes , right away .
before you can say “ come ” and “ go , ” and breathe twice , and shout “ so , so ! ” each one of your servants will rush here ,
it ’ s time for you to know the whole story .
give me a hand and help me off with this magic cloak .
not yet . ” well , the time has come .
can you remember the time before you came to live in this shack ?
i doubt it , since you weren ’ t even three at the time .
sure i can , father .
what do you remember ?
a house , a person ?
tell me anything you remember .
i love you dearly , ariel .
don ’ t come near till you hear me call you .
all right , i understand .
i assure you , sir , the tender love i feel in my heart is stronger than the sexual passions stirring down below .
good . — now come , ariel !
better to have an extra servant on hand than be understaffed .
appear before me now quickly — no talking .
just watch !
be quiet .
why has your queen , juno , called me here to this grassy spot ?
to celebrate a marriage of true love , and give a gift to the lovers .
tell me , rainbow , do you know if either venus , the goddess of love , or her son , cupid , is accompanying queen juno ?
ever since venus and her blind son plotted a way for the god of the underworld to steal my daughter away for half the year , i swore i ’ d never speak to them again .
don ’ t be afraid of her company .
i met venus as she was with her son on her way to her home on paphos , in a carriage pulled by doves .
they were planning to pull a mischievous trick on ferdinand and miranda , who have sworn not to sleep together till their wedding day .
but their trick failed .
venus went home again , and her little son broke all his arrows , swearing he ’ ll never shoot them again , but play with birds like other little boys .
great queen juno is coming .
i know her by her walk .
how is my generous sister ?
come help me bless this couple , so they will be prosperous and have many children .
this is a majestic and harmonious vision .
are these spirits we see before us ?
yes , they ’ re spirits that i ’ ve called out of their prisons to perform my whims .
let me live here forever .
such a wonderful father-in-law and wife make this place a paradise .
now be quiet .
juno and ceres are whispering about something serious .
there ’ s something else to be done .
be silent , or else my magic spell will be broken .
come , sweet nymphs , and help us celebrate the wedding of two true lovers .
don ’ t be late .
now , you tanned fieldworkers who are so tired of august ’ s labors , get out of the dirt and come rejoice with us here .
put your straw hats on , have some fun , and dance with these young nymphs .
the moment they planned to act is almost here .
i ’ ve never seen him like this .
we are all made of dreams , and our life stretches from sleep before birth to sleep after death .
sir , i ’ m upset .
please put up with my weakness .
my old brain is troubled .
don ’ t be disturbed by my illness .
if you like , you can rest a while in my room .
i ’ ll go for a short walk to calm down my feverish mind .
we hope you feel better and find some peace .
come , ariel — i summon you with a thought .
thank you , ariel .
come .
i obey all your thoughts .
what do you wish ?
spirit , we have to get ready to meet with caliban .
yes , my master .
when i was putting on the ceres show , i thought of reminding you about caliban , but i was afraid of upsetting you .
tell me again , where did you leave those lowlifes ?
then i beat my drum , at which point they pricked up their ears and opened their eyes , looking around for the source of my music .
i enchanted them so thoroughly that they followed me through thorn bushes and prickly shrubs that tore up their shins .
in the end i left them standing in the smelly pond behind your room , with the stinking water covering them up to their chins .
good job , my little one .
stay invisible .
bring the fancy clothes out of my house , to use as bait to catch these thieves .
i ’ m going , i ’ m going .
he ’ s a devil , a born devil , who can never be trained .
as his body grows uglier with age , his mind rots away as well .
i ’ ll torment them all till they roar with pain .
here , hang them on this clothesline .
please walk softly , so not even a mole hears us approach .
we ’ re near his room now .
hey monster , the spirit you ’ ve been talking about , the one you call harmless , has been playing tricks on us .
monster , i smell like horse piss , which is making my nose pretty upset .
mine too . — are you listening , monster ?
if i decide to get angry at you , just watch out — you ’ d be done for then , monster .
my good lord , i still need you to like me .
be patient , because the prize i ’ m leading you to will make you forget how smelly you are now .
so be quiet .
it ’ s as silent as a graveyard here .
that upsets me much more than getting wet .
and you called the fairy creature harmless , monster .
please , my king , be quiet .
look here , this is the entrance to his room .
be silent and go in .
do the deed that will make this island yours forever , and will make me , caliban , your worshipful foot-licker .
give me your hand .
i ’ m starting to feel murderous urges .
leave it alone , you fool .
it ’ s worthless .
oh , monster , we know secondhand clothes when we see them . — take off that gown , trinculo .
i swear that gown ’ s for me .
you can have it then , your highness .
to hell with this idiot !
why are you going crazy over these trashy clothes ?
leave them alone , and do the murder first .
if he wakes up before we kill him , he ’ ll never stop punishing us .
thank you kindly .
thank you for that joke .
as king of this country i like to reward wit when i hear it .
here ’ s another jacket to say thanks .
come here , monster , put some glue on your fingers , and carry away the rest of these clothes for us .
i won ’ t have any of this .
monster , use your fingers .
help us carry these clothes to where my barrel of wine is hidden , or i ’ ll kick you out of my kingdom .
go on , take them .
take these too .
yes , and these .
hey , mountain , hey !
silver .
there they go , silver !
my memory is hazy , more like a dream than a recollection .
didn ’ t i use to have four or five women taking care of me ?
indeed you did , and more besides , miranda .
but how is it possible that you still remember this , through all the darkness of the past ?
if you remember your life before you came here , you may also remember how you got here .
no , that i don ’ t remember .
twelve years ago , miranda , twelve years ago your father was the duke of milan , a powerful prince .
aren ’ t you my father ?
your mother was extremely virtuous , and she said you were my daughter .
and your father was duke of milan , and you were his heir , a princess .
good lord !
what evil things were done to us that we were driven here ?
or was it a blessing that we came here ?
both , both , my girl .
we were pushed out of power by evil deeds , as you call them .
fury , fury ! — get over there , tyrant , there .
listen , listen !
ariel , go order my goblin servants to make these fellows ' bones ache , give them muscle cramps all over , and give them more bruises than leopards have spots .
listen they ’ re howling .
hunt them down .
now all my enemies are at my mercy .
soon all my work will be done , and you ’ ll be free .
just obey me a little bit longer .
my plans are almost at their climax .
my spells are working well , my spirits are obeying me , and everything is right on schedule .
what time is it ?
it ’ s after six o 'clock , my lord , when you said our work would be finished .
that ’ s what i said when i first conjured the tempest .
tell me , spirit , how ’ s the king and his entourage ?
all cooped up together , just as you ordered , all imprisoned in the grove of linden trees that protects your room from bad weather .
they can ’ t move till you release them .
the king , his brother , and your brother are all waiting there in a crazed state of mind , and the rest are grieving over them , sad and astonished .
good old lord gonzalo , ” as you call him , is saddest of all , with tears running down his beard .
your magic spell has such an effect on them that if you saw them now , you ’ d feel sorry for them .
do you think so , spirit ?
i ’ d feel sorry for them , if i were human .
i will too .
it ’ s better to act virtuously rather than vengefully .
go release them , ariel .
i ’ ll break my spells and bring them back to their senses , and they ’ ll feel like themselves again .
i ’ ll go get them , sir .
with his own lightning bolts ; i ’ ve shaken up the sturdy cliffs and uprooted pines and cedars ; i ’ ve opened up graves and awakened the corpses sleeping in them , letting them out with my powerful magic .
let this solemn melody comfort your fevered minds , which are now useless , seething inside your skulls . — all of you stand there in my spell . —
why , that ’ s my dainty ariel singing now .
i ’ ll miss you , ariel , but you ’ ll be free . — yes , you will , yes . — go to the king ’ s ship in your invisible state .
this place is full of trouble , torments , and amazements .
there must be a strange explanation for this — if it ’ s true .
i surrender your dukedom and beg you to forgive me all my crimes .
but how is it possible that prospero ’ s alive and well and living on this island ?
i won ’ t bet on whether or not any of this is real .
welcome , my friends .
it ’ s the devil speaking through him .
you suffered a loss like mine ?
yes , just as great and just as recent .
and i have much less to comfort me than you do , since i ’ ve lost my daughter .
a daughter ?
oh god , i wish the two of them were alive and living in naples , as king and queen !
i ’ d give up my life and take my son ’ s place in the mud on the ocean floor if i could see them alive in naples . — when did you lose your daughter ?
in this recent storm .
no , my dearest love , i wouldn ’ t cheat you for the whole world .
if this dream vision is typical of what this island conjures up , then i ’ ll lose my son twice .
a wonderful miracle !
receive all the blessings of a happy father .
get up and tell me how you came here .
how amazing !
how many wonderful creatures there are here !
mankind is so beautiful !
oh , what a wonderful new world , that has such people in it !
it ’ s new to you .
no , sir , she ’ s human .
but by the grace of god , she ’ s mine .
i chose her for my wife when i thought i had no father to ask advice of .
she ’ s the daughter of this famous duke of milan i heard so much about but never saw before .
he ’ s given me a second life , and marrying her makes him a second father to me .
and i ’ m her father as well .
but oh , how odd it is to have to ask for my child ’ s forgiveness !
stop right there , sir .
let ’ s not get gloomy in our reminiscing , since there ’ s no reason for sadness anymore .
oh , it breaks my heart to think how painful it must be for you to recall all this , things that i can ’ t remember .
but please tell me more .
my brother , your uncle antonio — just listen to this ( i still can ’ t believe a brother could be so disloyal !
since i was so drawn to studying things like logic , grammar , geometry , and astronomy , i let my control of the government slide a bit , being too wrapped up in my occult books .
your disloyal uncle — are you paying attention ?
i ’ m hanging on every word .
oh , yes i am , father .
dear gods , bless this couple , since you ’ re the ones who have shown us the path that led us here .
amen to that , gonzalo .
was the duke of milan kicked out of milan so his children could become kings of naples ?
oh , this is cause for an extraordinary joy that should be engraved in gold on pillars to last forever .
on one and the same trip claribel found a husband in tunis , and ferdinand , her brother , found a wife where he was shipwrecked ; prospero found his dukedom on a poor island ; and all of us found ourselves when we lost control of ourselves .
so be it .
amen .
oh , look , sir , look , sir !
more of us are here .
the best news of all is that we ’ ve located our king and our men .
the next bit of good news is that our ship — which we gave up for ruined only three hours ago — is as well-outfitted and seaworthy as it was when we first set sail .
these are unnatural events .
in an instant we were separated from them , as if in a dream , and brought here in a daze .
this is a stranger business than men have ever set foot in before , and it ’ s not natural either .
we need some oracle to tell us what ’ s going on .
sir , my king , don ’ t waste your time mulling over how strange this business is .
how is my lord ?
if i can believe my eyes , this is a fine sight to see .
oh setebos , these are handsome spirits !
how wonderful my master is !
i ’ m afraid he ’ ll punish me .
ha , ha !
what are these things we ’ re looking at , my lord antonio ?
can you buy them with money ?
he ’ ll kill me with tortures .
isn ’ t this stephano , my drunken butler ?
he ’ s definitely drunk now .
where did he get wine ?
and trinculo ’ s drunk .
how are you doing , stephano ?
oh , don ’ t touch me .
i ’ m not stephano , i ’ m a walking cramp .
you wanted to be king of the island , sir ?
i would ’ ve been a sore king then .
he ’ s as ugly in his manners as he is in appearance . — i will indeed .
and after this i ’ ll be good and hope you forgive me .
what an idiot i was to think this drunkard was a god and to worship such a stupid fool !
go away , now .
or stole it , rather .
and in the morning i ’ ll take you to your ship and we ’ ll sail to naples , where i hope to see this loving couple married .
i ’ m dying to hear your life story , which must be a strange tale .
now my spells are all broken , and the only power i have is my own , which is very weak .
release me so i can return to my dukedom with your help .
just as you ’ d like to have your sins forgiven , indulge me , forgive me , and set me free .
please listen to me carefully .
as i neglected practical matters , being totally dedicated to solitude and to improving my mind with subjects more valuable than most people imagine , i was so shut away from the world that i unwittingly stirred up evil wishes in my disloyal brother .
my deep trust in him made him deeply untrustworthy , arousing in him a treachery as big as my trust was — my trust which had no limit , an infinite confidence .
with his ambition growing like this — do you hear what i ’ m saying ?
of course i hear it .
my library was a large enough dukedom for me .
good heavens !
think about that , and about what followed afterward .
then tell me if antonio can be called a brother .
it would be wrong for me to think poorly of my grandmother .
how awful !
i can ’ t remember how i cried then , but i ’ ll cry all over again .
this story breaks my heart .
just listen a little more , and i ’ ll bring you up to date about the present situation , which is the whole reason i ’ m telling you this story in the first place .
why didn ’ t they just kill us that night ?
good question , my girl .
my story does raise that question .
the answer , my dear , is that they didn ’ t dare , because the people of milan loved me too much .
god , what a burden on you i must have been !
no , my dear , you were a little angel who kept me going .
you smiled with a strength you must have gotten from heaven , while i cried salty tears into the salty sea , and groaned at our situation .
how did we manage to get ashore ?
with god ’ s help .
we had a little food and fresh water that a nobleman from naples , gonzalo , had given us out of the kindness of his heart .
knowing how much i loved my books , he gave me some books from my library that i value more than my dukedom .
i wish i could see that man someday !
now i ’ ll stand up .
may god thank you for it .
but please , father — the question is still nagging at me — why did you conjure up this storm ?
you should know this : much luck is on my side , and my enemies have happened to wreck their ship on this island .
now , no more questions .
it ’ s a nice hazy feeling , so give in to it .
i know you have no choice .
come on , servant , come .
i ’ m ready now .
come here , ariel .
humble greetings , great master !
worthy sir , greetings !
spirit , did you carry out the storm just as i ordered ?
sometimes i appeared in many places at once .
i flashed about faster than lightning .
good spirit !
boatswain !
i ’ m here , sir .
hurry , hurry !
come on , men !
that ’ s the way to do it !
where ’ s the master ?
make these men work .
please stay below deck , sir .
where ’ s the master , boatswain ?
everyone there got a little crazy and pulled some desperate stunts .
everyone except the sailors dove into the sea , leaving behind the ship that i had set on fire .
the king ’ s son , ferdinand , with his hair standing straight up — it looked like reeds , not hair — was the first person to jump , shouting , “ hell is empty , and all the devils are here ! ” good job !
but was this near the shore ?
very near , my master .
but are they all safe , ariel ?
nobody was hurt in the slightest .
even their clothes are unstained , and look fresher than before the storm .
i ’ ve separated them into groups around the island , just as you ordered .
i sent the king ’ s son off by himself to a faraway nook on the island , where he ’ s sitting now sighing , with his arms crossed like this .
tell me what you did with the king ’ s ship , the sailors , and the other ships .
the sailors are all below deck , sleeping both from their labor and from a magic spell i cast over them .
as for the rest of the ships , i scattered them , and they ’ ve gathered again in the mediterranean , sailing sadly home to naples , believing that they witnessed the shipwreck and death of their great king .
ariel , you ’ ve done your work exactly as i ordered .
but there ’ s more work to be done .
what time is it ?
past noon .
at least two hours past .
we can ’ t waste time between now and six o 'clock .
is there more work to do ?
since you ’ re giving me new assignments , let me remind you what you promised me but haven ’ t come through with yet .
what ?
you ’ re in a bad mood ?
what could you possibly ask for ?
my freedom .
before your sentence has been completed ?
don ’ t say anything else .
i beg you , remember the good work i ’ ve done for you , and how i ’ ve never lied to you , never made mistakes , and never grumbled in my work .
you promised to take a full year off my sentence .
have you forgotten the torture i freed you from ?
no .
you have forgotten , and you think it ’ s a burden when i ask you to walk through the ocean , or run on the north wind , or do business for me underground when the earth ’ s frozen solid .
no , i don ’ t , sir .
you lie , you nasty , ungrateful thing !
have you forgotten the horrid witch sycorax , stooped over with old age and ill will ?
have you forgotten her ?
no , sir .
you have .
where was she born ?
speak .
tell me .
in algiers , sir .
oh , was she now ?
i ’ ll have to tell the story again every month , since you seem to forget it .
this damned witch sycorax was kicked out of algiers for various witching crimes too terrible for humans to hear about .
but for one reason they refused to execute her .
isn ’ t that true ?
yes , sir .
this sunken-eyed hag was brought here pregnant and left by the sailors .
you , my slave , were her servant at the time , as you admit yourself .
that ’ s right , you stupid thing .
caliban , who now serves me .
it was my magic that saved you when i arrived on the island and heard you , making the pine tree open and let you out .
thank you , master .
if you complain any more , i ’ ll split an oak tree and lock you up in it till you ’ ve howled for twelve years .
please forgive me , master .
i ’ ll be obedient and do all my tasks without complaining .
do that , and i ’ ll set you free in two days .
that ’ s noble of you , master .
what shall i do for you ?
just tell me .
what shall i do ?
go disguise yourself as a sea nymph .
be invisible to everyone except yourself and me .
take this garment , put it on , and then come back here .
hurry , go !
shake off your sleepiness .
come on .
we ’ ll go visit caliban , my slave who always talks to us so nastily .
but even so , we can ’ t do without him .
he builds our fires , gets our firewood , and does all kinds of useful things for us . — hey !
caliban !
pile of dirt !
say something .
come out , i order you .
there ’ s other work for you to do .
come on , you turtle !
what a fine sight !
my dear clever ariel , listen carefully .
my lord , i ’ ll do it right away .
i hope you both get drenched with a dew as evil as what my mother used to collect with a crow ’ s feather from the poison swamps .
may a hot southwest wind blow on you and cover you with blisters all over .
i ’ ll give you cramps for saying that — horrible pains in your sides that will keep you from breathing .
i ’ ll send goblins out at night to work their nasty deeds on you .
you ’ ll be pricked all over , and it ’ ll sting like bees .
i have to eat my dinner now .
this island belongs to me because sycorax , my mother , left it to me .
i curse myself for doing that !
you liar , you respond better to the whip than to kindness !
i took good care of you — piece of filth that you are — and let you stay in my own hut until you tried to rape my daughter .
oh ho , oh ho !
i wish i had !
you stopped me .
you horrid slave , you can ’ t be trained to be good , and you ’ re capable of anything evil !
i pitied you , worked hard to teach you to speak , and taught you some new thing practically every hour .
but you had bad blood in you , no matter how much you learned , and good people couldn ’ t stand to be near you .
so you got what you deserved , and were locked up in this cave , which is more fitting for the likes of you than a prison would be .
you taught me language , and all i can do with it is curse .
damn you for teaching me your language !
no , please .
go then , slave .
the watchdogs bark .
listen , listen !
where ’ s that music coming from ?
from the earth , or the air ?
it ’ s stopped now — it must be played for some local god of the island .
as i sat on the shore crying over my father ’ s shipwreck , i heard the music creep over the wild waves , calming their fury and soothing my own grief with its sweet melodies .
i followed it here , or i should say it dragged me here .
but now it ’ s stopped .
no , there it is again .
listen , i hear them .
this song ’ s about my dead father .
i hear it now overhead .
what is it ?
a spirit ?
lord , it ’ s glancing every which way !
how handsome it is .
it must be a spirit .
no , girl !
it eats and sleeps and has the same five senses we do .
he ’ s lost his comrades and is wandering around looking for them .
he ’ s busy , can ’ t you hear him giving orders ?
you ’ re getting in the way of our work .
stay in your cabins .
you ’ re helping the storm , not us .
don ’ t get wound up , my good man .
now get out of here !
go to your cabins and be quiet !
don ’ t bother us up here .
just remember who you ’ ve got on board with you , good man .
nobody i care about more than myself .
you ’ re a king ’ s advisor .
go ahead , use your authority .
if you can ’ t do it , be grateful you ’ ve lived this long and go wait to die in your cabin , if it comes to that . — harder , men ! — now get out of our way , i ’ m telling you .
i feel a lot better after talking to this guy .
i could imagine he ’ s divine , since i never saw anything so noble-looking on earth before .
i ’ m not marvelous , sir , but i ’ m certainly a maiden .
she speaks my language !
my god , i ’ m the highest-ranking person who speaks this language — if only we were back where it ’ s spoken .
what ’ s that ?
the highest-ranking ?
what would the king of naples do if he heard you say that ?
he would just see me for what i am , a person amazed to hear you talking about naples .
he does hear me , and that makes me cry .
i myself am the king of naples , since i saw with my own eyes — these eyes that haven ’ t been dry since — my father killed in a shipwreck .
ah , how pitiful !
yes , indeed , and all the king ’ s men , the duke of milan and his fine son too .
hang on , sir !
just a moment .
if the devil had such a beautiful house as his body , then good things would fight to live in it .
what ’ s that ?
get out of that position , because i can disarm you with my magic wand and make your sword drop .
please , father , i beg you .
let go of me !
don ’ t tug on my clothes .
father , take pity on him .
quiet !
if you say one more word , i ’ ll punish you , maybe even hate you .
you ’ re defending an impostor ?
you think he ’ s special , since you ’ ve only ever seen him and caliban .
foolish girl , in the eyes of most people this man ’ s a caliban , and compared to him , they ’ re angels .
then my love is humble .
i don ’ t feel any urge to see a more handsome man than this one .
that ’ s true , they are .
my strength is all gone , as if in a dream .
a prison like that would give me enough liberty .
please say no more .
what a pain .
pain , yes indeed .
you thought you were being funny , but you said the truth .
you ’ re taking it more seriously than i meant it .
well , i ’ m nearly finished .
which one will start yammering first , gonzalo or adrian ?
the old guy .
i pick the younger one .
you ’ re on .
what ’ s the prize ?
a good laugh .
it ’ s a deal !
though this island may appear desolate —
the island must be mild , and have a temperate climate .
i knew temperance — she was a fine girl .
yes , and she was mild too .
there ’ s always a breath of fresh air here .
stinking like a swamp .
this island contains everything beneficial to life .
true .
everything except something to live on .
there ’ s little or nothing of that .
look how lush and healthy the grass is !
how green !
the ground is brown .
with a touch of green in it .
he doesn ’ t miss a thing .
no , he just gets reality completely wrong .
but the really unbelievable thing is — and this is incredible — as most unbelievable things are .
that our clothes were drenched with sea water , but they came out looking brand-new .
or stuff what he says into their pockets .
seriously , i think our clothes are as fresh now as they were the day we put them on in africa , when we attended the marriage of the king ’ s daughter claribel to the king of tunis .
it was a lovely wedding , and we ’ re doing really well on our trip home .
tunis has never had such a beautiful queen .
next thing you know , he ’ ll be saying “ widower aeneas . ” “ widow dido , ” did you say ?
i ’ m not sure about that .
dido was from carthage , not tunis .
carthage ?
i ’ m telling you , it was carthage .
gonzalo is a miracle-worker .
what miracle will he work next ?
i think he ’ ll carry this island home in his pocket and give it to his son like an apple .
and then throw the seeds in the sea , to make more islands grow .
yes indeed .
absolutely , yes indeed .
bring down that top sail !
fast !
let the ship sail close to the wind .
damn those men shouting down there !
they ’ re louder than the storm or us sailors .
oh , not you again .
what do you want ?
should we all give up and drown ?
do you want to sink ?
yes , i guarantee he won ’ t drown — even if this ship were as fragile as an eggshell and as leaky as a menstruating woman .
turn the ship to the wind !
it ’ s no use !
we ’ re done for !
the most beautiful queen they ever had .
i beg your pardon , except for the widow dido .
oh , except for the widow dido ?
that ’ s right , except for the widow dido .
isn ’ t my vest just as clean and fresh as the day i put it on ?
in a way , i mean .
in a way ” is the right way to go .
i mean when i wore it at your daughter ’ s wedding .
you keep cramming words into my ears that i don ’ t want to hear .
sir , he may still be alive .
i have no doubt he got ashore alive .
no , no , he ’ s dead .
please be quiet .
we all begged you not to go ahead with those marriage plans , and your lovely daughter struggled between disgust at marrying an african and the desire to obey you .
now i ’ m afraid we ’ ve lost your son forever .
our shipwreck has made more women widows in milan and naples than there are survivors to comfort them .
and it ’ s all your fault .
and the greatest sorrow is mine too .
my lord sebastian , even though what you say is true , your way of saying it is tactless and comes at the wrong time .
you ’ re rubbing salt in his wounds when you should be applying bandages .
all right , i ’ ll stop .
like a good doctor .
bad times ?
yes , very bad .
if i could colonize this island , my lord — he ’ d cultivate weeds on it .
or thorn-bushes .
and if i were king of it , you know what i ’ d do ?
he wouldn ’ t get drunk much , since there ’ s no wine here .
i wouldn ’ t allow any commerce .
there ’ d be no work .
there ’ d be no kingship — he wants to be king in a place with no kingship .
everything would be produced without labor , and would be shared by all .
nature would produce its harvests in abundance , to feed my innocent people .
there ’ d be no marriage ?
no .
oh , please be quiet .
you ’ re absolutely right , your highness .
it ’ s you we were laughing at .
ouch , what a comeback !
too bad it fell flat .
you ’ re brave gentlemen .
you ’ d give the moon a shove if it got stuck five weeks in its orbit .
that ’ s right , and then after we fixed the moon , we ’ d go bird-hunting .
i ’ m not .
go to sleep , and listen to us laughing .
what , everybody falls asleep so fast ?
i wish i could sleep too — it would stop me from thinking .
come to think of it , i am feeling sleepy .
in that case you should sleep .
the two of us will guard you while you sleep , my lord , and keep you safe .
thank you .
i ’ m terribly sleepy .
how strange that they all got so sleepy !
there must be something in the air here .
so why aren ’ t our eyelids heavy ?
i ’ m not sleepy at all .
me neither .
i ’ m wide awake .
they all fell asleep together , as if they ’ d planned it .
opportunity ’ s knocking for you , and in my imagination i see a crown dropping onto your head .
are you dreaming or awake ?
don ’ t you hear me speaking ?
i do , and it sounds like you ’ re talking in your sleep .
what did you say ?
you ’ re snoring , but it sounds like you ’ re talking .
there ’ s meaning in your snoring .
i ’ ll show you how .
you need to .
oh , if you only knew how close to success you are , even while you make fun of what i ’ m telling you !
the more you joke about it , the more clearly i feel how serious it is !
lazy people end up at the bottom , and you deserve to be at the top .
please , tell me more .
yes , i ’ m sure he ’ s dead .
i ’ ve got no hope that he survived .
but in that “ no hope ” there are great hopes for you !
do you agree that ferdinand must have drowned ?
he ’ s dead .
so , in that case , tell me who ’ s next in line to inherit the kingdom of naples ?
claribel , his daughter .
it ’ s true that my brother ’ s daughter is queen of tunis , and heir of naples .
i could do it myself .
do you even get what i ’ m saying ?
i think i do .
and does this prospect of good fortune make you happy ?
i remember you took the throne from your brother prospero .
my brother ’ s servants used to be my equals .
now they work for me .
but what about your guilty conscience ?
yes .
i don ’ t feel anything .
as
for the other men , we can make them believe anything we choose .
they ’ ll set their watches to whatever time we say .
you ’ ll be my role model .
just as you got milan , i ’ ll get naples .
take out your sword .
with one cut you can be through paying money to naples .
and as king i ’ ll love you forever .
you take out your sword too .
when i raise my hand , you do the same , and bring it down on gonzalo ’ s head .
oh , but there ’ s one more thing to tell you .
what , we ’ re going to die ?
the king and the prince are praying .
i ’ m out of patience .
this bigmouth jerk here — ( he ’ ll still die by hanging , not drowning , even if every drop of water in the sea tries to swallow him .
let ’ s all sink with the king .
let ’ s say goodbye to him .
let ’ s act quickly .
why are your swords out ?
why do you look like that ?
what ’ s this all about ?
while we were here guarding you as you slept , we heard a loud roar that sounded like bulls , or lions .
didn ’ t you hear it ?
we heard it very clearly .
i didn ’ t hear anything .
oh , it was a monstrous roar , to make the earth tremble !
i ’ m sure there was a herd of lions nearby .
did you hear this , gonzalo ?
it ’ s true i heard a humming sound , a strange one , which woke me up .
i shook you and shouted at you , sir .
when i opened my eyes , i saw their swords out .
there was a noise , that ’ s certainly true .
let ’ s draw our own swords too .
i hope those lions stay far away from him .
i ’ m sure he ’ s somewhere on the island .
get us out of here .
his spirits are listening to me , but i can ’ t help cursing him anyway .
they won ’ t pinch me , frighten me , push me in the mud , or mislead me unless he tells them to .
sometimes snakes wrap around me , hissing at me with their forked tongues till i go crazy .
hey , look over there !
maybe he won ’ t see me .
there are no bushes or shrubs to protect me from the weather here .
and there ’ s another storm brewing — i can hear it in the way the wind whistles .
that huge black cloud over there looks like a filthy liquor jug that ’ s about to pour out its contents .
a strange fish .
if i were in england now , like i was once , and i had even a painted picture of this fish , every fool there would give me a piece of silver to look at it .
in england this strange monster would be just like a man .
any strange beast there can be considered a man .
the men there won ’ t give a penny to a lame beggar , but they ’ ll pay ten cents to look at a freak show exhibit .
this guy has legs like a man but fins for arms !
and he ’ s still warm , by god .
i guess this is not a fish , but a native who got struck by lightning just now .
oh , here comes the storm again .
the best thing to do is crawl under his cloak .
there ’ s no other shelter around here .
in emergencies you meet the strangest folks .
i ’ ll just stay here till the storm passes .
this is a rotten song to sing at a man ’ s funeral .
at least i ’ ve got some booze to comfort me .
don ’ t hurt me .
oh !
what ’ s going on ?
do we have devils on the island ?
are you playing tricks on me by showing me savages and uncivilized men from the indies , ha ?
i didn ’ t survive a shipwreck so i could be scared of your four legs now .
the spirit is torturing me .
oh !
this is some monster of the island , with four legs , who seems to me to have some kind of ache .
how the hell does he know our language ?
i ’ ll help out , if only because he speaks the same language as me .
if i can cure him from his fever and tame him , and get him back to naples , he ’ d make a great present for any emperor .
don ’ t hurt me , please .
i promise i ’ ll carry the wood faster .
he ’ s having a fit and talking nonsense .
i ’ ll give him some liquor .
if he ’ s never drunk it before , it ’ ll help soothe his fever .
if i can tame him , i ’ ll charge as much as i can get for him .
he ’ ll bring a lot of money to the person who owns him , that ’ s for sure .
now , you lie there on the path .
she said if she were interested in someone , it would be someone who looked like me .
besides , she treats me more respectfully than the other servants .
what ’ s the obvious conclusion from that ?
just think , i could be count malvolio !
lady strachy married her wardrobe manager .
i ’ d send seven of my servants to go get him .
while i waited , i ’ d frown impatiently , and perhaps wind my watch , or play with my — with some expensive piece of jewelry i happen to be wearing .
i can ’ t let my lips say his name ; “ no man must know . ”
no man must know . ” what comes after that ?
no man must know . ” what if this someone were you , malvolio ?
but silence , like a knife , cuts open my heart with strokes that draw no blood .
rules my life . ” hmm , let me see , let me see , let me see .
i may command the one i love . ” well , she commands me .
why , anyone can see what this means .
there ’ s no ambiguity here .
if only i could somehow relate them to me !
you seem to be a good person , captain , and although people who look beautiful are often corrupt inside , i believe that you have a beautiful mind to go with your good looks and manners .
please — and i ’ ll pay you plenty for this — help me conceal my identity , and find me the right disguise so i can look the way i want .
i want to be this duke ’ s servant .
you ’ ll introduce me to him as a eunuch .
you won ’ t be wasting your time , because i really can sing and talk to him about many different kinds of music , so he ’ ll be happy to have me in his service .
you can be a eunuch , but i ’ ll be mute .
i swear on my life i won ’ t tell your secret .
thank you .
show me the way .
m ” — malvolio .
m ” — why , that ’ s the first letter in my name .
but if i shake it up a little it ’ ll work , because every one of those letters is in my name .
but wait , there ’ s some prose after her poem .
if this letter falls into your hands , think carefully about what it says .
by my birth i rank above you , but don ’ t be afraid of my greatness .
some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them .
your fate awaits you .
accept it in body and spirit .
to get used to the life you ’ ll most likely be leading soon , get rid of your low-class trappings .
go ahead .
goodbye .
signed , she who would be your servant , the fortunate unhappy . ” this is as clear as sunlight in an open field .
i ’ ll do it .
i ’ ll be vain and proud , i ’ ll read up on politics , i ’ ll insult sir toby , i ’ ll get rid of my lower-class friends , and i ’ ll be the perfect man for her .
i know i ’ m not fooling myself , or letting myself get carried away by my imagination , because every clue points to the fact that lady olivia loves me .
she did compliment me on my yellow stockings recently , and she said she liked how the crisscross laces looked on my legs .
oh , i thank my lucky stars , i ’ m so happy .
for her i ’ ll be strange and condescending , and i ’ ll put on my yellow stockings and crisscross laces right away .
thank god and my horoscope !
here ’ s a postscript ! .
you must have figured out who i am .
if you love me , let me know by smiling at me .
you ’ re so attractive when you smile .
please smile whenever you ’ re near me , my dearest darling . ”
dear god , thank you !
i ’ ll do everything she wants me to do .
i wouldn ’ t have missed this even for a pension of thousands of pounds , to be paid by the shah of persia .
i could marry that maria for thinking this up .
so could i.
and i wouldn ’ t ask for any dowry except for her to play another trick like this one .
neither would i.
here she comes , the brilliant fool-catcher .
may i kiss your feet ?
and i too ?
shall i be your slave ?
me too .
you ’ ve made him so delusional he ’ ll go crazy when he learns the truth .
did it really work ?
like medicine for a sick man .
if you want to watch , follow me .
i ’ d follow you to the gates of hell , you sneaky little devil !
i ’ ll come too .
god bless you , my friend , and your music too .
do you make your living by playing that drum ?
no , sir , i live by the church .
oh , you ’ re a clergyman ?
you could just as easily say that a king sleeps near a beggar if the beggar lives near him , or that the church is supported by your drum because it “ stands by ” your drum .
you ’ re right , sir .
what a wonderful time to be alive !
that ’ s true .
that ’ s why i wish my sister didn ’ t have a name , sir .
why , man ?
well , her name ’ s a word , and if you fooled around with it you might make her into a whore .
why do you say that ?
honestly , sir , i ’ d need to use words to explain why , and since words are so unreliable and false , i ’ d rather avoid using them in a serious discussion .
i bet you ’ re a happy fellow who doesn ’ t care about anything .
you ’ re wrong , sir , i do care about something .
but i ’ ll admit i don ’ t care for you .
if that means i don ’ t care about anything , you should disappear right now , since you ’ re nothing .
aren ’ t you lady olivia ’ s fool ?
no , sir .
i saw you at count orsino ’ s recently .
i ’ m everywhere .
i think i saw you there , you wise man .
wait , here ’ s a coin for you .
next time god sends out a shipment of hair , i hope he gives you a beard !
oh , i know .
yes , if you kept them together and invested them .
my lady olivia ’ s inside , sir .
i ’ ll tell them where you come from , though i don ’ t know who you are or what you want .
i ’ d say i was “ out of my element , ” but that phrase is overused , so i ’ ll say i ’ m “ out of my air . ”
this guy ’ s wise enough to play the fool , and only clever people can do that .
and he doesn ’ t let go of his target when a distraction appears .
hello , sir .
hello to you too , sir .
i ’ m headed for your niece , sir .
she ’ s the reason i ’ m here .
taste your legs , sir .
please go inside .
i mean please go into the house , sir .
i will .
but now we don ’ t have to !
oh , beautiful and accomplished lady , may the heavens rain odors upon you !
my message is not for anyone else to hear , my lady .
it ’ s only for your willing and receptive ear .
close the garden door and leave me alone to hear his message .
give me your hand , sir .
i give you my obedience and my humble service , madam .
what ’ s your name ?
cesario is my name — your servant ’ s name — fair princess .
my servant !
the world ’ s gone downhill since fake humility started passing for compliments .
as for him , i never think about him .
as for his thoughts , i wish he ’ d think about nothing at all rather than think about me all the time .
madam , i ’ ve come here to try to make you like him .
oh , please , i ’ m begging you , don ’ t mention him again .
my dear lady — please let me say something , i ’ m begging you .
after you cast your magic spell on me last time , i sent you a ring .
what else could you possibly think of me ?
what ’ s wrong with my niece ?
for god ’ s sake , sir toby , you ’ ve got to come home earlier at night .
my lady olivia , your niece , disapproves of your late-night partying .
well , she can get used to it .
keep myself ?
they ’ re good enough to drink in , and so are these boots .
if they aren ’ t , they can go hang themselves by their own laces !
who , sir andrew aguecheek ?
yes , that ’ s the one .
he ’ s as
haven ’ t you totally dismissed my honor and integrity in your anger ?
for someone as intelligent as you the situation must be clear enough .
so let me hear what you have to say .
i feel sorry for you .
that ’ s a step in the direction of love .
no , not at all .
it ’ s much better to be destroyed by a noble enemy than by a cruel and heartless one .
i wish you all the best .
you do stay , please , tell me what you think of me .
i think you ’ re denying what you really are .
if that ’ s true , i think the same thing about you .
i wish you were what i wanted you to be !
would it be better if i were that , instead of what i am ?
i wish i were something better , because right now i ’ m a big fool .
so goodbye , my lady .
no , i won ’ t stay a second longer .
why are you leaving , my angry friend ?
yes , you have to tell us why , sir andrew .
well , because i saw your niece olivia treat the count ’ s messenger better than she ’ s ever treated me .
i saw it in the orchard .
did she see you there the whole time , old boy ?
tell me that .
yes , she saw me quite clearly .
well , that proves she ’ s in love with you .
are you trying to make fun of me ?
no , i ’ ll prove it with airtight evidence and logical argument .
and you can ’ t deny evidence and argument — they ’ ve been around since noah ’ s ark .
she flirted with the messenger boy to exasperate you , fire up your passions , and make you angry and jealous .
you should have run up to her , unleashed a few excellent quips invented on the spot , and rendered the young man speechless .
that ’ s what she was expecting , and you let her down .
i ’ ll have to do something courageous then , because i hate intrigue .
i ’ d rather be a heretic than a schemer with fancy plots .
well then , improve your situation with a show of courage .
challenge the count ’ s young servant to a fight .
hurt him in eleven different places .
my niece olivia will notice , and let me tell you , no matchmaker in the world can get you a woman faster than a reputation for courage .
it ’ s really the only way , sir andrew .
will either of you give him the message that i ’ m challenging him to a duel ?
go ahead and write it down .
be pointed and brief .
it doesn ’ t need to be witty as long as it ’ s eloquent and imaginative .
go on .
this precious little guy is putty in your hands , sir toby .
his letter ’ s going to be hilarious .
but you ’ re not going to deliver it , are you ?
never trust me again if i don ’ t .
and by all means see if you can get the young man to answer it .
i don ’ t think a team of oxen could get them close enough to fight .
here comes my little bird .
listen , if you want a good laugh — and i mean a side-splitting one — then follow me .
he ’ s wearing yellow stockings .
with crisscrossed laces ?
oh , he looks like a pathetic sunday school teacher .
he smiles so much his face has more lines in it than a map of the east indies .
you ’ ve never seen anything like it .
i can hardly keep myself from throwing things at him .
i know that my lady ’ s going to end up hitting him .
and when she does , he ’ ll imagine she ’ s flirting with him .
come on , take us to him .
i couldn ’ t stay behind after you left .
my friend antonio , all i can say is thank you .
anyway , what should we do ?
should we go see the sights in the town ?
you probably killed a lot of his men ?
the whole quarrel might have been resolved since then when we repaid what we stole from them — which most of our city did , for the sake of friendly trade relations .
i was the only one who refused to give back what i stole .
then don ’ t make yourself too conspicuous .
you ’ re right .
hang on a minute , here ’ s some money for you .
maybe you ’ ll see some little trinket you want to buy .
i ’ ll hold on to your money and leave you for an hour .
we ’ ll meet at the elephant .
i remember .
i ’ ve sent for him .
he says he ’ ll come .
it ’ s easier to buy young people than to beg or borrow them .
oh , i ’ m talking too loud . — where ’ s malvolio ?
he ’ s very serious , which is right for someone in mourning like me .
where is malvolio ?
he ’ s coming , madam ; but he ’ s acting very strangely .
he must be possessed by the devil .
why , what ’ s the matter with him ?
is he talking nonsense ?
no , he just smiles .
you should have a guard nearby if he comes in here , because he ’ s clearly disturbed .
ask him in here .
i ’ m as crazy as he is , if sad craziness and happy craziness are equivalent .
what ’ s going on , malvolio ?
hello , sweet lady .
why , he has an income of three thousand ducats a year .
he ’ s a fool and a spendthrift .
you shouldn ’ t talk about him like that !
anyone who says that is a lying piece of garbage .
who said that ?
the same people who say he gets drunk with you every night .
we only drink toasts to my niece .
i ’ ll drink to her as long as there ’ s a hole in my throat and booze in illyria .
anyone who refuses to drink to my niece until his brain spins around like a merry-go-round is scum .
sir toby belch !
how are you , sir toby belch ?
sweet sir andrew !
you ’ re smiling ?
i sent for you about a sad occasion .
sad , my lady !
i could be sad if i wanted to be .
these crisscrossing laces do cut off the circulation in my legs a bit , but who cares ?
as the sonnet says , “ if you please one special person , you please everyone who matters . ” why , what ’ s going on ?
what ’ s the matter with you ?
my legs may be yellow , but i don ’ t feel blue .
it was addressed to him , and orders must be obeyed .
i think we know whose fancy handwriting that was .
don ’ t you think you should go to bed , malvolio ?
to bed !
how are you feeling , malvolio ?
you ’ re asking me !
noble people don ’ t answer to peasants !
why are you acting so brazen toward my lady ?
don ’ t be afraid of greatness . ” that was well written .
what do you mean by that , malvolio ?
some are born great — ”
what ?
some achieve greatness — ” what are you saying ?
and some have greatness thrust upon them . ” heaven help you !
remember who liked your yellow stockings — ” your yellow stockings ?
and wanted to see you with laces crisscrossed over your legs . ” crisscrossed ?
go ahead .
madam , count orsino ’ s young messenger has returned .
i ’ ll go to him .
maria , take care of this poor fellow here .
where ’ s my cousin toby ?
have some of my servants take care of malvolio .
i ’ d give half my dowry to keep anything bad from happening to him .
oh ho !
look at me now !
this is just what the letter said .
get rid of your low-class trapping , ” she said .
i ’ ve got her now , but i ’ ve got god to thank for it !
nothing can come between me and the fulfillment of all my hopes .
well , god is responsible for that , not me , and he deserves thanks .
i don ’ t care if all the devils in hell crammed together to possess him , i still want to speak to him .
here he is , here he is .
how are you , sir ?
go away .
let me enjoy my privacy .
go away .
ah-ha !
does she ?
do you even know what you ’ re talking about ?
sure thing , we ’ ll do it tomorrow morning .
my lady would never want to lose him .
what are you saying , mistress ?
oh , lord !
gentleness is the only way to go — gently , gently .
the devil inside him is rough , but we can ’ t treat it roughly .
sir !
yes , dear little chick , come along with me . — shut up , man !
you ’ re serious enough to know not to play games with satan .
damn that dirty black coalminer of a devil !
get him to say his prayers , sir toby , get him to pray .
my prayers , you hussy ?
go hang yourselves , all of you !
you ’ re all lazy and shallow .
i ’ m not like you .
you ’ ll know more about it later .
is it possible ?
if this were a play , i ’ d complain it was unrealistic .
he ’ s really taken this prank to heart .
no , follow him now , before he divulges the prank and ruins everything .
wow , we ’ re really going to drive him crazy .
the house will be so much quieter .
come on , let ’ s put him in a dark room and tie him up .
my niece already thinks he ’ s insane .
here ’ s more insanity for us .
is it that aggressive ?
yes , it is , i think .
just read it .
give it to me .
that ’ s a good thing to put in — it keeps you from getting in trouble with the law .
nice and short and full of good sense — or should i say nonsense ?
good .
you still haven ’ t said anything incriminating .
good .
andrew aguecheek ”
if this letter doesn ’ t make him fight , i don ’ t know what will .
i ’ ll give it to him .
you might have a great opportunity to give it to him right now .
he ’ s conducting some business with my lady , and sooner or later he ’ ll leave .
go , sir andrew .
look out for him in the corner of the orchard as if you were a sheriff ’ s deputy .
now go !
don ’ t worry about me not swearing enough .
the fact that he serves as a go-between for his lord and my niece olivia confirms this .
so this letter , which is so incredibly stupid and ignorant , isn ’ t going to scare him at all .
he ’ ll just think an idiot wrote it .
this will make them both so afraid that they ’ ll kill each other just by looking at each other .
here comes the messenger with your niece .
leave them alone until he sets off home , and then follow him .
meanwhile , i ’ ll think of some horrible way to phrase the challenge .
my lord acts just as crazy with love as you do .
here , take this piece of jewelry .
there ’ s a picture of me inside .
don ’ t refuse it .
it won ’ t annoy you like me , because it doesn ’ t have a voice .
and i beg you , please come here again tomorrow .
what could you possibly ask of me that i wouldn ’ t give you , as long as it didn ’ t damage my honor and self-respect ?
nothing , except your true love for my lord .
how could i honorably give him what i ’ ve already given you ?
i ’ ll give it back to you .
just come again tomorrow .
good-bye .
a devil like you could lead me to hell .
hello , sir .
hello to you .
you ’ d better think up a way to defend yourself .
i don ’ t know what you ’ ve done to upset him , but someone has challenged you to a duel .
draw your sword and get on your toes , because your assailant is quick , skillful , and deadly .
there must be some mistake , sir .
i ’ m sure nobody would have any reason to fight with me .
i can ’ t remember anything i ’ ve ever done to offend anyone .
you ’ re wrong about that , i assure you .
but who is this person , sir ?
he ’ s a knight .
he ’ s killed three people , and he ’ s so furious right now that the only thing that will satisfy him is seeing you die .
fight to the death ” is his motto .
hello , sir .
chat her up , sir andrew .
what ?
my dear miss chat-her-up , i look forward to getting to know you better .
my name is mary , sir .
i was telling you to go after her , woo her , confront her .
is that really what you meant ?
if you let her go this easily , sir andrew , you don ’ t deserve to ever use your sword again .
if you leave like this , my dear , i won ’ t ever use my sword again .
do you think you ’ ve got a couple of fools on your hands here ?
i ’ m not holding your hand , sir .
i ’ ll go back inside and ask the lady for some kind of escort .
i ’ m not a fighter .
i ’ ve heard of men who pick fights with other people on purpose , just to see how brave they are .
this man is probably like that .
no , sir .
he ’ s furious because you insulted him , and he has a right to satisfaction .
so go out there and give him what he wants .
you can ’ t go back into the house unless you want to fight with me — and if you ’ re willing to do that , you might as well just go and fight with him .
this is as rude as it is strange .
please , do me this one favor : find out what i ’ ve done to offend this knight .
it must be something i did accidentally .
i will do so .
mr. fabian , stay with this gentleman until i come back .
excuse me , sir , do you know anything about this ?
what kind of man is he ?
he really is the most skillful , bloodthirsty , and dangerous opponent you can find in illyria .
do you want to go see him ?
i ’ ll try to calm him down for you if i can .
i ’ d be very grateful to you if you did .
wow , he ’ s a real devil .
i ’ ve never seen such a monster .
i had a round with him , and his sword thrust is so deadly that you can ’ t even duck out of the way .
and when he strikes back at you , he ’ ll hit you as sure as you ’ re standing there .
they say he used to fence for the shah of persia .
that ’ s it !
i won ’ t mess with him .
yes , but now there ’ s no way to calm him down .
fabian can hardly control him over there .
darn it , if i ’ d guessed he was so brave and such a good swordsman , i never would have challenged him .
i ’ ll give him my gray horse capilet if he forgets the whole thing .
i ’ ll give it a try .
stay right here and try to look good .
this may end without anyone getting killed .
he ’ s just as terrified of sir andrew .
he ’ s pale and hyperventilating , as if a bear were chasing him .
come on , sir andrew , there ’ s nothing you can do about it .
the gentleman insists on fighting a round with you , for the sake of his honor .
the rules of dueling say he has to .
but as a gentleman and a soldier he ’ s promised me he won ’ t hurt you .
come on , get ready .
i hope to god he keeps his promise !
i swear to you , i don ’ t want to be doing this .
put your sword away .
if this young gentleman has offended you , i ’ ll take the blame for it .
if you ’ ve offended him , i ’ ll fight you .
you , sir ?
who are you ?
in fact , i ’ d do even more to him than what you ’ ve heard him promise to do .
if you ’ re someone who gets into fights , i ’ ll fight with you .
oh , sir toby , stop !
the police are here .
i certainly will , sir .
and as for what i promised to you , i ’ m as good as my word .
you can ride him easily , and he responds well when you pull the reins .
this is the man .
do your job .
antonio , you ’ re under arrest on the orders of count orsino .
you must be mistaking me for someone else , sir .
no , sir , not at all .
i recognize your face perfectly , even without a sailor ’ s cap on your head . — take him away .
he knows i recognize him .
i have to obey .
don ’ t worry about me .
come on , sir , let ’ s go .
what money , sir ?
take this .
it ’ s half of all my money .
are you really going to pretend you don ’ t know me now ?
i hate an ungrateful man more than i hate lying , vanity , babbling , drunkenness , or any other vice that we feeble human beings are susceptible to . — oh , my god !
come on , sir , please .
let ’ s go .
let ’ s go !
but oh , what a deceiver he turned out to be !
only really cruel people can be called deformed .
virtue is beauty , but someone beautiful and wicked is like an empty box decorated by the devil .
the man ’ s going crazy .
take him away .
take me .
i don ’ t believe it .
yet i wish i could .
oh , please be true , please let it be that this man has mistaken me for you , my dear brother !
come here , sir andrew .
you too , fabian .
we ’ ve got some words of wisdom to mull over .
he called me sebastian .
with the same accessories .
oh , if it turns out to be true that he survived , then that storm was kind , and the ocean was full of love !
he ’ s a very dishonest , puny boy , and more cowardly than a rabbit .
he abandoned his friend here in an emergency , and even pretended he didn ’ t know him .
as for his cowardliness , ask fabian .
he ’ s a coward , a total coward .
by god , i ’ ll go after him again and beat him up .
i swear i will — come on , let ’ s go see what happens .
i ’ ll bet anything you like that nothing will happen , once again .
leave me alone .
good for you , holding out on me like this !
nothing is what it is .
oh please , go somewhere else to blab your nonsense .
you don ’ t know me .
blab my nonsense ?
he must ’ ve heard that phrase describing some great man and now he ’ s using it on a jester .
blab my nonsense !
what an idiotic place this world is .
now please stop being so strange and tell me what exactly i should blab to my lady .
should i blab to her that you ’ re coming ?
please , fool , go away .
here ’ s money for you .
well , well .
wise men who give fools money might get a good reputation — if they keep up regular payments for fourteen years .
stop right now or i ’ ll throw your dagger over the roof .
no , leave him alone .
i ’ ll get back at him another way .
i ’ ll sue him for assault and battery , if there ’ s any justice in illyria .
it doesn ’ t matter that i hit him first .
no , sir , i won ’ t let you go .
come on , put your sword away , my little soldier .
you ’ re awfully eager to fight .
come on .
i ’ ll get free of you .
what are you going to do now ?
if you insist on trying my patience any further , then take out your sword right now .
what ?
because then i ’ d have to shed an ounce or two of your impudent blood .
stop , sir toby !
i order you to stop !
madam !
are you always going to be like this ?
get out of my sight ! — dear cesario , please don ’ t be offended . — get out of here , you barbarian !
you have to come with me .
please don ’ t say no .
damn that toby !
he made my heart leap for you .
why , sweetheart ?
your hand is well , i hope so .
i ’ m not such an idiot that i can ’ t keep my hands dry .
but i don ’ t get it — what ’ s the joke ?
just a bit of my dry humor , sir .
are you always so funny ?
but oops , when i let go of your hand , i let go of the biggest joke of all .
sir , you need a drink .
when has anyone ever put you down like that .
never .
sometimes i think i ’ m no smarter than average .
if this is a dream , let me keep on sleeping !
come with me , please .
i wish you ’ d do what i ask !
madam , i will .
oh , say it , and mean it !
no , i ’ m telling you , put on this robe and beard .
make him think you ’ re sir topas the priest .
be quick .
meanwhile , i ’ ll get sir toby .
here come the conspirators .
god bless you , mr.
priest .
go to him , sir topas .
the fool ’ s a good actor .
a good fool .
sir topas , sir topas , good sir topas , please go find my lady olivia — get out , demon !
why are you bothering this poor man !
can ’ t you talk about anything besides ladies ?
you should be ashamed of yourself , satan , you liar !
i ’ m being gentle with you , because i ’ m one of those good-hearted people who are polite to the devil himself .
you call this house dark ?
dark as hell , sir topas .
but it has bay windows that are as transparent as stone walls , and the upper windows facing south-north are as clear as coal .
but you ’ re still complaining of darkness and a bad view ?
i ’ m not insane , sir topas .
i ’ m telling you , this house is dark .
you ’ re wrong , you madman .
there ’ s no darkness except ignorance , and you ’ re more ignorant than the egyptians during the plague of fog .
i tell you , this house is as dark as ignorance .
i ’ m no more insane than you are , and i ’ ll prove it .
ask me any commonsense question .
what was the philosopher pythagoras ’ s belief about wild birds ?
that our grandmother ’ s soul could end up inhabiting a bird .
what do you think of his belief ?
i respect the soul very much , so i disagree with his belief .
well then , goodbye .
stay in the dark .
i ’ ll only admit that you ’ re sane when you agree with pythagoras and hesitate to kill a bird because it might contain your grandmother ’ s soul .
goodbye .
sir topas , sir topas !
the brilliant sir topas !
i can do anything !
you could ’ ve done this without your beard and gown .
he couldn ’ t see you .
now talk to him in your own voice , and tell me how he is .
i wish this trick would be over .
i ’ m in so much trouble with my niece that it wouldn ’ t be safe to let this prank go to its conclusion .
come to my room later on .
fool !
fool !
fool , i say !
good fool , good jester , i ’ ll make it worth your while if you get me a candle , and a pen , ink and paper .
you have my word as a gentleman that i ’ ll always be grateful to you .
master malvolio ?
yes , good fool .
as sane as me ?
then you really are insane , if you ’ re no saner than a fool .
sir topas !
fool , fool , hey , fool !
please , sir , be quiet .
what do you want to say , sir ?
be a nice fool and help me find a candle and some paper .
i tell you , i ’ m as sane as any man in illyria .
if only you were , sir .
i swear i am .
get me some ink , paper , and a candle .
you ’ ll get a bigger reward than you ever got delivering a letter before .
i ’ ll help you .
but tell me honestly , are you sure you ’ re not insane ?
or are you just pretending ?
believe me , i ’ m not .
i ’ m telling the truth .
i ’ ll never believe a madman until i can see his brains .
but i ’ ll get you a candle and paper and ink .
fool , i ’ ll repay you for this favor .
please , hurry .
this is the air , that ’ s the glorious sun .
where ’ s antonio , then ?
i didn ’ t find him at the elephant .
but he ’ d been there before me , and they told me he ’ d gone out looking for me .
i could really use his advice right now .
there ’ s something going on that ’ s not what it seems .
but here she comes .
i ’ ll follow the priest and go with you ; and after i ’ ve sworn to be faithful , i ’ ll be faithful forever .
then lead the way , father .
if you ’ re my friend , you ’ ll let me see his letter .
dear mr. fabian , do me another favor first .
anything .
don ’ t ask to see this letter .
my friends , are you all lady olivia ’ s servants ?
yes , sir , we ’ re part of her entourage .
i know you .
how are you , my friend ?
i ’ m better off because of my enemies , and worse off because of my friends .
you ’ re better off because of your friends .
no , sir , worse off .
how can that be ?
by the way , i ’ m going home tomorrow , sir toby .
what does you ’ d have a great hairstyle if you had .
why , would that have fixed my hair ?
oh , no question — it won ’ t style itself .
but my hair looks good anyway , doesn ’ t it ?
it looks great .
it hangs like an old worn-out mop .
listen , i ’ m going home tomorrow , sir toby .
that duke who lives nearby is courting her .
i ’ ve heard her say that .
so cheer up , there ’ s still hope for you , man .
well , my friends praise me and make me look like an idiot , while my enemies tell me straightforwardly that i am an idiot .
my enemies help me understand myself better , which is an advantage , and my friends help me lie about myself , which is a disadvantage .
so if four negatives make two affirmatives , i ’ m worse off because of my friends and better off because of my foes .
that ’ s excellent .
don ’ t say that — unless you want to be one of my friends .
that ’ s a nice hand you dealt me .
but if it ’ s not double-dealing , sir , i wish you ’ d deal me another .
oh , you ’ re a naughty one , encouraging double-dealing .
well , i ’ ll commit the sin of double-dealing , and deal you a second coin .
here it is .
and maybe a third ?
the three-beat rhythm is a good for dancing , and the church bells chime — one , two , three .
you can ’ t get any more money out of me right now .
if you tell your lady i ’ m here to speak with her , and bring her out with you when you come back , you might make me more generous .
well then , sing a lullaby to your generosity : it ’ ll nap until i come back .
but don ’ t think i ’ m doing this because i ’ m greedy .
i ’ ll be back soon to wake up your generosity .
here comes the man who rescued me , sir .
i remember his face well .
though the last time i saw him it was black from the smoke of war .
orsino , this is the same antonio who took the
but then he said strange things to me .
i don ’ t know what else it could be .
but you ’ re a famous pirate !
orsino , sir , please don ’ t call me those names .
i was never a thief or a pirate , though i admit i was your enemy for good reasons .
i rescued that ungrateful boy next to you from drowning .
he was a wreck , almost past hope .
i saved his life and gave him my love , without reservation .
how is that possible ?
ah , the countess is coming !
an angel is walking on earth .
what can i give you that you want , my lord , except the one thing you can ’ t have ?
cesario , you missed your appointment with me .
madam ?
dearest olivia — what do you have to say for yourself , cesario ? — my lord , please — my lord wants to speak .
it ’ s my duty to be quiet .
are you still so cruel ?
i am still so faithful , my lord .
what , faithful to being mean and nasty ?
i breathed from my soul the most faithful offerings to your ungrateful altars that any devoted person has ever offered — what more am i supposed to do ?
you can do whatever you want as long as it ’ s socially appropriate .
come with me , boy .
and i would die a thousand deaths cheerfully , if it made your life easier .
where ’ s cesario going ?
that ’ s the truth .
who tricked you ?
who treated you badly ?
have you completely forgotten ?
has it been so long ?
call the priest .
go where , my lord ? — cesario , my husband , stay here .
husband ?
yes , husband .
can he deny it ?
are you her husband , boy ?
no , my lord , not me .
but don ’ t be afraid , cesario .
be the person you know you are , and you ’ ll be as powerful as this person you fear .
oh , hello , father !
father , could i please ask you to tell these people what happened between me and this young man ?
my lord , i swear to you — oh , don ’ t swear !
keep a little bit of honesty , even if you ’ re afraid .
for the love of god , call a doctor !
sir toby needs help right away .
what ’ s the matter ?
he cut my head and gave sir toby a bloody head , too .
for the love of god , help us !
i ’ d give forty pounds to be safe at home right now .
who did this , sir andrew ?
the count ’ s messenger , cesario .
we thought he was a coward , but he fights like a devil .
my cesario ?
anything i did to you , i did it because sir toby made me .
why are you talking like this ?
i never hurt you .
if a bloody head counts as a hurt , then you hurt me .
apparently you think there ’ s nothing unusual about a bloody head .
here comes sir toby , limping .
he ’ ll tell you more of the story .
if he hadn ’ t been drunk , he would ’ ve really roughed you up .
hello , sir !
how are you ?
it doesn ’ t matter how i am : he hurt me , and that ’ s that .
oh , he ’ s drunk , sir toby , for a whole hour now .
his eyes started glazing over around eight in the morning .
then he ’ s no good .
i hate no-good drunks .
take him away !
who did this to him ?
i ’ ll help you , sir toby .
will you help me ? — what an ass and a fool , a gullible no-good idiot !
get him to bed and make sure his wounds are treated .
but please forgive me , darling , for the sake of the vows we made to each other so recently .
one face , one voice , one way of dressing , but two people !
antonio , oh my dear antonio !
i ’ ve been so tortured since i lost track of you !
are you sebastian ?
do you have any doubts , antonio ?
how did you divide yourself in two ?
these two people are as identical as two halves of an apple .
which one is sebastian ?
how unbelievable !
sebastian was my father ’ s name , and my brother was named sebastian too .
i am a spirit , yes , since i have a soul .
if you were a woman , i ’ d hug you now and cry , and say “ welcome back , drowned viola ! ” my father had a mole on his forehead .
mine did too .
he died on viola ’ s thirteenth birthday .
all right , i ’ ll stay another month .
ah , i ’ m an odd kind of guy .
sometimes all i want to do is see plays and go out dancing .
are you good at those kinds of things ?
why do you hide these things ?
why do you keep these talents behind a curtain ?
are they likely to get dusty ?
why don ’ t you go off to church dancing one way , and come home dancing another way ?
i wouldn ’ t even pee without dancing a waltz .
what are you thinking ?
is this the kind of world where we hide our accomplishments ?
look how shapely your legs are .
that ’ s true .
why not ?
weren ’ t we both born under taurus ?
oh , i remember that very clearly !
it ’ s true , he died on the day my sister turned thirteen .
give me your hand and let me see you dressed in woman ’ s clothing .
the captain who brought me to shore has my women ’ s clothes .
for some reason he ’ s in prison now on some legal technicality , on malvolio ’ s orders .
he ’ ll release him .
i was so crazy myself that i forgot all about him .
well , he keeps the devil away as well as a man can in his situation .
he ’ s written you a letter .
i would ’ ve given it to you this morning , but a madman ’ s letters aren ’ t gospel , so it doesn ’ t matter much if i ’ m a bit late .
open it and read it .
there ’ s a lot to learn when a fool recites the words of a madman .
why are you talking like that ?
are you insane ?
no , madam , i ’ m just reading an insane letter .
if you want things done in the right way , you ’ ll have to let me read a crazy letter in a crazy voice .
no , please , read it like a sane person .
i will , my lady , but a sane person reading this would make it sound crazy .
so listen up , princess .
i swear to god , madam , you ’ ve wronged me , and i ’ ll tell the whole world .
you ’ ve shut me up in a dark room and given your drunken cousin authority over me , but i ’ m as sane as you are .
i don ’ t care what you think of me .
i ’ m going to forget my duties to you a little bit and complain about the injuries you ’ ve caused me .
signed , the poorly treated malvolio . ” did he write this ?
yes , madam .
set him free .
fabian , bring him here .
i accept that offer happily , madam .
is this the madman ?
yes , my lord .
how are you , malvolio ?
madam , you ’ ve treated me badly , very badly .
i did , malvolio ?
no .
tell me why you did it .
i ’ m sorry , malvolio , but this isn ’ t my writing , though i admit it looks like mine .
it ’ s definitely maria ’ s handwriting .
now that i think about it , maria was the one who first told me you were insane .
i promise .
well , you know , “ some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon them . ” anyway , i was part of the trick , sir .
he really was tricked horribly .
go after him and try to calm him down a little .
he still hasn ’ t told us about the captain .
cesario , come here .
taurus !
that governs the torso and heart , doesn ’ t it ?
no , the legs and thighs .
let me see you dance .
he ’ s only known you for three days , but he ’ s already treating you like a close friend .
no , not at all .
thanks for telling me .
here comes the duke now .
has anyone seen cesario ?
be loud and obnoxious .
i don ’ t think so , my lord .
my boy , it ’ s true .
anyone who says you ’ re a man must not notice how young you are .
i know you ’ re the right person for this job .
i ’ ll do my best to make this lady love you .
give me too much of it , so i ’ ll get sick of it and stop loving .
oh , it sounded like a sweet breeze blowing gently over a bank of violets , taking their scent with it .
it doesn ’ t sound as sweet as it did before .
love is so vivid and fantastical that nothing compares to it .
do you want to go hunting , my lord ?
hunting what , curio ?
lady olivia will have you executed for not showing up .
so let her execute me .
how do you know ?
well , he ’ ll be dead , so he won ’ t see anything .
that ’ s a lame answer .
where , good miss mary ?
from soldiers .
well , we all have our special gifts .
but still , she ’ s going to kill you for being gone so long .
you ’ ve made up your mind , then ?
well , go along now .
you ’ d be the funniest person in illyria … if sir toby ever stopped drinking .
shut up , you troublemaker , no more of that .
here comes my lady .
get that fool out of here .
didn ’ t you hear her , guys ?
get the lady out of here .
oh , go away , you ’ re a boring fool .
i don ’ t want to have anything to do with you anymore .
besides , you ’ ve gotten unreliable .
if he cannot , let the tailor mend him .
anything that ’ s mended is only patched up .
a good person who does something wrong is only patched up with sin .
if this logic works , that ’ s great .
if not , what can you do about it ?
i told them to take oh , what a big mistake !
please let me prove you ’ re a fool .
can you do that ?
easily , madam .
i ’ ll have to ask you some questions , madam .
please answer , my good little student .
i ’ m listening to you only because i ’ ve got nothing better to do .
my dear madam , why are you in mourning ?
my dear fool , because my brother died .
i think his soul ’ s in hell , my lady .
i know his soul ’ s in heaven , fool .
then you ’ re a fool for being sad that your brother ’ s soul is in heaven .
take away this fool , gentlemen .
what do you think of this fool , malvolio ?
isn ’ t he getting funnier ?
yes , and he ’ ll keep getting funnier till he dies .
old age always makes people act funny — even wise people , but fools more than anybody .
i hope you go senile soon , sir , so you can become a more foolish fool !
sir toby would bet a fortune that i ’ m not smart , but he wouldn ’ t bet two cents that you ’ re not a fool .
what do you say to that , malvolio ?
i ’ m surprised you enjoy the company of this stupid troublemaker .
the other day i saw him defeated in a
i swear , anyone smart who laughs at these courts jesters is nothing but a jester ’ s apprentice .
malvolio , your vanity is damaging your good taste .
you speak so highly of fools !
madam , there ’ s a young gentleman at the gate who really wants to speak to you .
was he sent by count orsino ?
i don ’ t know , madam .
he ’ s a good-looking young man , and there are a lot of people with him .
who ’ s talking to him now ?
sir toby , madam , your relative .
he talks nothing but nonsense .
if he ’ s got a message from the count , tell him i ’ m sick , or not home .
who ’ s that at the gate , uncle ?
a gentleman .
a gentleman ?
what gentleman ?
there ’ s some gentleman out there . — good sir toby !
nonsense .
i defy brain-death !
i told you , someone ’ s at the gate .
yes , but who is he ?
let him be the devil if he wants to , i don ’ t care .
god will protect me .
tell me what a drunk is like , fool .
he ’ s a fool , a madman , and a drowned man .
the first drink makes him a fool , the second makes him crazy , and the third drowns him .
go take care of him .
madam , that young man out there says he ’ s got to speak to you .
i told him you were sick .
he claimed he knew that , and that ’ s why he ’ s come to speak with you .
i told him you were asleep .
he claimed to know that already too , and said that ’ s the reason he ’ s come to speak with you .
what can i say to him , lady ?
he ’ s got an answer for everything .
tell him he ’ s not going to speak with me .
just a man , like any other .
but what ’ s he like ?
he insists he ’ ll speak with you whether you want him to or not .
how old is he ?
not old enough to be a man , but not young enough to be a boy .
he ’ s somewhere between boy and man .
he ’ s very handsome and speaks well , but he ’ s very young .
he looks like he just recently stopped breastfeeding .
show him in .
call in my maid .
maria , our lady wants you .
give me my veil .
come , put it over my face .
which one of you is the lady of the house ?
you can speak to me .
i represent her .
what do you want ?
what stunning , exquisite , and unmatchable beauty — but please , tell me if you ’ re the lady of the house , because i ’ ve never seen her .
i ’ d hate to waste my speech on the wrong person , because it ’ s very well written and i spent a lot of time and energy memorizing it .
beautiful ladies , please don ’ t treat me badly .
i ’ m very sensitive , and even the smallest bit of rudeness hurts my feelings .
where do you come from , sir ?
i ’ m sorry , but i memorized what i ’ m supposed to say here today , and that question isn ’ t part of the speech i learned .
please , my lady , just confirm that you ’ re the lady of the house so i can get on with my speech .
are you an actor ?
no , madam .
but i swear i ’ m not the person i ’ m playing .
are you the lady of the house ?
i am , unless i somehow stole this role .
if you ’ re the lady of the house , then it ’ s true you ’ re stealing your role , because what ’ s yours to give away is not yours to keep for yourself .
but that ’ s not part of what i ’ m supposed to say .
i ’ ll go on with my speech praising you , and then i ’ ll get to the point .
get to the point now .
i ’ ll let you get away with skipping the praise .
that ’ s too bad , because i spent a long time memorizing it , and it ’ s poetic .
that means it ’ s more likely to be fake .
please , keep it to yourself .
if you ’ re just insane , then get out of here .
ready to set sail , sir ?
the door ’ s right here .
tell me what you want .
tell me what it ’ s about .
it ’ s about you .
i ’ m not bringing any declarations of war or demands for cash .
i ’ m coming in peace .
but you began so rudely .
who are you ?
what do you want ?
what ’ s going on ?
what have you heard from her ?
take me to the garden .
who i am and what i want are a secret .
everyone , please leave us alone for a moment .
most sweet lady — oh , “ sweet ” !
where ’ s the passage of holy scripture that you ’ re basing your sermon on ?
in orsino ’ s heart .
in his heart ?
in what chapter and verse of his heart ?
the table of contents says it ’ s in the first chapter of his heart .
oh , i ’ ve read that .
that ’ s not holy , it ’ s heresy .
do you have anything else to say ?
madam , please let me see your face .
has your lord given you any orders to negotiate with my face ?
you ’ re overstepping your bounds now .
but i ’ ll open the curtain and let you see the picture .
look , sir , this is a portrait of me as i am at this particular moment .
it ’ s pretty well done , isn ’ t it ?
wind and rain can ’ t wash it off .
oh , i ’ d never be that cruel .
i ’ ll write out a detailed inventory of my beauty and label every part .
but you ’ d still be gorgeous even if you were as proud as the devil .
my lord loves you .
how does he love me ?
your lord knows what i think .
i can ’ t love him .
i know he ’ s noble , rich , young , and with a fine reputation .
people say he ’ s generous , well educated , and brave , and he ’ s very attractive .
but i just can ’ t love him .
what would you do about it ?
from that cabin i ’ d call out to my soul .
i ’ d write sad songs about unrequited love and sing them loudly in the middle of the night .
not bad ; you might accomplish something .
but i ’ m still fairly high-ranking .
i ’ m a gentleman .
go back to your lord .
i can ’ t love him .
tell him not to send any more messengers — unless you feel like coming back to tell me how he took the bad news .
goodbye .
thanks for your trouble .
here ’ s some money for you .
i ’ m not a paid messenger , my lady .
keep your money .
it ’ s my master who ’ s not getting the reward he deserves , not me .
goodbye , you beautiful , cruel woman .
but i ’ m still fairly high-ranking .
ah , no .
calm down , calm down .
if only his lord were more like him .
how strange i ’ m feeling !
can someone fall in love this quickly ?
come here !
at your service , madam .
run after that obnoxious messenger , the duke ’ s servant .
he insisted on leaving this ring with me whether i wanted it or not .
madam , i will .
i don ’ t know what i ’ m doing .
fate , do your work .
we human beings don ’ t control our own destinies .
what is fated to happen must happen .
no , i ’ d rather you stayed here .
at least tell me where you ’ re going .
honestly , i can ’ t .
i ’ m just wandering , with no particular destination .
but i know you ’ d never force me to tell you things i don ’ t want to , so i should be polite and tell you what i can .
he left behind myself and my twin sister , who was born in the same hour as me .
if god had been willing , i wish we had died in the same hour too !
an hour before you pulled me out of the breaking waves , my sister drowned .
how tragic !
although many people said she looked like me , she was considered beautiful .
she ’ s been drowned in salty sea water , and now my salty tears are about to drown her memory all over again .
oh , antonio , i ’ m sorry i caused you so much trouble .
please let me be your servant so i can be with you .
i like you very much .
i ’ m going to count orsino ’ s court .
goodbye .
i wish you all the best .
if i didn ’ t have so many enemies in orsino ’ s court , i ’ d go join you there .
but who cares .
excuse me , weren ’ t you with countess olivia just now ?
yes , sir .
i ’ ve only made it this far since i left her place , walking at a moderate pace .
she ’ s sending this ring back to you , sir .
you should ’ ve saved me some trouble and taken it away yourself .
here , take the ring .
she took that ring from me .
i won ’ t take it back .
you threw it at her rudely , and she wants you to take it back .
i didn ’ t give her any ring .
what ’ s she trying to say ?
i hope she doesn ’ t have a crush on me !
it ’ s true she looked at me a lot , in fact , she looked at me so much that she seemed distracted , and couldn ’ t really finish her sentences very well .
oh , i really think she loves me !
creet .
i ’ m the man she wants .
if that ’ s true , which it is , she might as well be in love with a dream , the poor lady .
ah , how will this all turn out ?
what can possibly fix this situation ?
oh , only time can sort out this mess .
i can ’ t figure it out by myself !
come on , sir andrew .
and the doctors say it ’ s healthy to get up early — i don ’ t know what the doctors say .
all i know is that staying up late is staying up late .
a false conclusion .
i hate your logic as much as i hate an empty drinking cup .
you ’ re a smart guy .
so we should eat and drink .
maria !
bring us some wine !
look , here comes the fool .
hello , my friends !
what a pretty picture , three fools all together .
hello , you idiot .
sing us a song .
what country is this , friends ?
this is illyria , lady .
and what am i supposed to do in illyria ?
my brother is in heaven .
or maybe there ’ s a chance he didn ’ t drown . — what do you think , sailors ?
it was a total fluke that you yourself were saved .
oh , my poor brother !
but maybe by some fluke he was saved too .
it ’ s possible , ma 'am .
don ’ t give up yet .
i was born and raised less than three hours from here .
i swear , this fool has an excellent singing voice .
my girlfriend has beautiful white hands , and great warriors aren ’ t ha , ha !
would you rather hear a love song or a song about the good life ?
a love song , a love song .
yes , yes .
i ’ m not interested in being good .
that was excellent , really excellent .
good , very good .
a beautiful voice , i swear .
his breath stinks .
yes , it stinks very sweetly .
should we sing a round to wake up the night owl ?
should we do that ?
let ’ s go for it .
absolutely .
let ’ s dance to “ you jerk . ” you mean , “ shut up , you jerk ” ?
so i ’ ll be forced to call you a jerk , sir andrew .
it starts , “ shut up . ” i ’ ll never be able to start if i shut up .
that ’ s true .
but come on , start .
you ’ re making a terrible racket out here !
lady olivia told her servant malvolio to kick you out of the house .
for god ’ s sake , shut up !
are you all crazy ?
what ’ s wrong with you ?
are you making all this noise at this time of night because you have no manners , or because you ’ re just stupid ?
don ’ t you have any respect for anything ?
we respected the beat of the song , sir .
so shut up !
sir toby , i ’ ve got to be frank with you .
my lady told me to tell you that while she lets you stay at her house because you ’ re a relative , she doesn ’ t approve of your behavior .
if you can shape up , you ’ re welcome to stay in the house .
if you can ’ t , and would prefer to leave , she ’ s very willing to say goodbye to you .
no , good sir toby .
that ’ s out of tune , sir .
you lie .
they certainly will .
you ’ re right .
go and wiggle your ears !
i could challenge him to a duel and then not show up .
do that .
i ’ ll write a letter challenging him to a duel on your behalf .
or i ’ ll deliver your insults to his face .
dear sir toby , don ’ t do anything rash tonight .
ever since the duke ’ s messenger visited olivia , she ’ s been upset .
as for monsieur malvolio , let me take care of him .
i know i can do it .
oh , i ’ ll beat him up for that !
i don ’ t have any “ brilliant ” reason for it , but i have a good enough reason .
that ’ s the weakness i ’ ll use to get revenge on him .
what are you going to do ?
i can make my handwriting look just like lady olivia ’ s : she
excellent !
i like it too .
he ’ ll think these letters are from olivia and that she ’ s in love with him .
yes , that ’ s the idea .
he ’ s going to look like a total idiot .
absolutely , you idiot .
this is going to be great !
it ’ s going to be fun , i promise .
i know my medicine will work on him .
i ’ ll have you two hide — and the fool too — right where he ’ ll find the letter .
watch his reaction .
meanwhile , let ’ s go to bed and dream about this .
good night .
good night , you amazing woman , you .
she ’ s a fine woman , all right .
she ’ s a good little woman , and she adores me .
what about it ?
someone adored me once , too .
let ’ s go to bed , knight .
tomorrow you need to get more money sent to you .
i know i will too , if it ’ s the last thing i do .
it ’ s too late to go to bed now .
play me some music .
sir , the person who should sing that song isn ’ t here .
who was it ?
he ’ s somewhere else in the house .
you ’ re absolutely right .
i ’ d bet my life that , as young as you are , you ’ ve fallen in love with someone .
haven ’ t you , boy ?
a little bit .
what kind of woman is she ?
she ’ s a lot like you .
she ’ s not good enough for you , then .
how old is she ?
about as old as you are , my lord .
that ’ s definitely too old .
a woman should always pick an older man .
i think you ’ re right , sir .
so find someone younger to love , or you won ’ t be able to maintain your feelings .
women are like roses : the moment their beauty is in full bloom , it ’ s about to decay .
that ’ s true .
it ’ s too bad their beauty fades right when it reaches perfection !
who ’ s the ruler here ?
a duke who is noble in name and character .
what ’ s his name ?
orsino .
orsino .
i ’ ve heard my father mention him .
when i first heard about him , he was still a bachelor .
but there was a rumor — you know , people always gossip about royalty — that he was in love with the beautiful olivia .
who ’ s she ?
i wish i could work for that lady !
are you ready , sir ?
no trouble , sir .
i like singing .
then i ’ ll pay you for doing what you like .
you may leave .
goodbye .
all the rest of you can leave too .
cesario , go visit that cruel olivia one more time .
but if she can ’ t love you , sir ?
i refuse to accept that .
but you have to .
just imagine some lady might exist who loves you as powerfully and agonizingly as you love olivia .
shouldn ’ t she just accept that ?
no woman is strong enough to put up with the kind of intense passion i feel .
no woman ’ s heart is big enough to hold all my love .
they eat too much and get indigestion and nausea .
it ’ s as all-consuming and insatiable as the sea , and it can swallow as much as the sea can .
don ’ t compare a woman ’ s love for a man with my love for olivia .
yes , but i know — what do you know ?
i know a lot about the love women can feel for men .
actually , their hearts are as sensitive and loyal as ours are .
my father had a daughter who loved a man in the same way that i might love you , if i were a woman .
and what ’ s her story ?
there was no story , my lord .
doesn ’ t that sound like true love ?
but did your sister die of love ?
i am the only daughter in my father ’ s family , and all the brothers too — but i ’ m not completely sure about that .
anyway , sir , should i go see the lady ?
come along with us , signor fabian .
i ’ m coming , don ’ t worry .
if i miss this , let me be boiled alive .
won ’ t you be glad to see that rascal dog humiliated ?
i ’ ll be thrilled .
you know , he got me in trouble with the lady of the house once when i arranged a bear-baiting here .
we ’ ll have another bear-baiting just to make him angry , and we ’ ll mock him till he ’ s black and blue .
won ’ t we , sir andrew ?
if we don ’ t , it ’ ll be the biggest disappointment of our lives .
here comes the little villain herself .
how are you , my golden girl ?
hide behind the boxwood hedge , all three of you .
malvolio ’ s coming down the path .
he ’ s been over there practicing how to act for the past half hour .
this letter ’ s going to turn him into a starry-eyed idiot .
