What is your tidings?
The king comes here tonight.
Thou 'rt mad to say it.
Is not thy master with him, who, were ’t so, Would have informed for preparation?
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming.
One of my fellows had the speed of him, Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more Than would make up his message.
Give him tending.
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here, And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full Of direst cruelty.
Make thick my blood.
Stop up the access and passage to remorse, That no compunctious visitings of nature Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between The effect and it!
Come to my woman’s breasts, And take my milk for gall, you murd'ring ministers, Wherever in your sightless substances You wait on nature’s mischief.
Come, thick night, And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell, That my keen knife see not the wound it makes, Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark To cry “Hold, hold!”
