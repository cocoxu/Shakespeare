What was the second noise for?
Why, for that too.
They shouted thrice.
What was the last cry for?
Why, for that too.
Was the crown offered him thrice?
Ay, marry, was ’t, and he put it by thrice, every time gentler than other, and at every putting-by mine honest neighbors shouted.
Who offered him the crown?
Why, Antony.
Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it.
It was mere foolery.
I did not mark it.
I saw Mark Antony offer him a crown (yet ’twas not a crown neither, ’twas one of these coronets) and, as I told you, he put it by once—but, for all that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.
Then he offered it to him again, then he put it by again—but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it.
And then he offered it the third time.
He put it the third time by.
And still, as he refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked Caesar—for he swooned and fell down at it.
And for mine own part, I durst not laugh for fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
