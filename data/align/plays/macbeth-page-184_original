Directly.
Foul whisp'rings are abroad.
Unnatural deeds Do breed unnatural troubles.
Infected minds To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets.
More needs she the divine than the physician.
God, God forgive us all!
Look after her, Remove from her the means of all annoyance, And still keep eyes upon her.
So, good night.
My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
I think, but dare not speak.
Good night, good doctor.
