Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
He sups tonight with a harlotry, and thither will I go to him.
He knows not yet of his honorable fortune.
If you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one) you may take him at your pleasure.
I will be near to second your attempt, and he shall fall between us.
Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with me.
I will show you such a necessity in his death that you shall think yourself bound to put it on him.
It is now high suppertime, and the night grows to waste.
About it!
I will hear further reason for this.
And you shall be satisfied.
