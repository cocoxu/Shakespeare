Now, lords, for France, the enterprise whereof Shall be to you as us, like glorious.
We doubt not of a fair and lucky war, Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous treason lurking in our way To hinder our beginnings.
We doubt not now But every rub is smoothèd on our way.
Then forth, dear countrymen.
Let us deliver Our puissance into the hand of God, Putting it straight in expedition.
Cheerly to sea.
The signs of war advance.
No king of England if not king of France.
