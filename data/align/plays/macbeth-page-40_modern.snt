If this business would really be finished when I did the deed, then it would be best to get it over with quickly.
If the assassination of the king could work like a net, sweeping up everything and preventing any consequences, then the murder would be the be-all and end-all of the whole affair, and I would gladly put my soul and the afterlife at risk to do it.
But for crimes like these there are still punishments in this world.
By committing violent crimes we only teach other people to commit violence, and the violence of our students will come back to plague us teachers.
Justice, being equal to everyone, forces us to drink from the poisoned cup that we serve to others.
The king trusts me in two ways.
First of all, I am his kinsman and his subject, so I should always try to protect him.
Second, I am his host, so I should be closing the door in his murderer’s face, not trying to murder him myself.
Besides, Duncan has been such a humble leader, so free of corruption, that his virtuous legacy will speak for him when he dies, as if angels were playing trumpets against the injustice of his murder.
Pity, like an innocent newborn baby, will ride the wind with winged angels on invisible horses through the air to spread news of the horrible deed to everyone everywhere.
People will shed a flood of tears that will drown the wind like a horrible downpour of rain.
I can’t spur myself to action.
The only thing motivating me is ambition, which makes people rush ahead of themselves toward disaster.
