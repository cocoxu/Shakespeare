Hail, King of Scotland!
We shall not spend a large expense of time Before we reckon with your several loves And make us even with you.
My thanes and kinsmen, Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland In such an honor named.
What’s more to do, Which would be planted newly with the time, As calling home our exiled friends abroad That fled the snares of watchful tyranny, Producing forth the cruel ministers Of this dead butcher and his fiendlike queen, Who, as ’tis thought, by self and violent hands Took off her life; this, and what needful else That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace, We will perform in measure, time, and place.
So, thanks to all at once and to each one, Whom we invite to see us crowned at Scone.
