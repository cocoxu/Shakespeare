This wind you talk of, blows us from ourselves.
Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
I fear too early, for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night’s revels, and expire the term Of a despisèd life closed in my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
But he that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail.
On, lusty gentlemen.
Strike, drum.
