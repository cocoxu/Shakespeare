All this”?
Ay, more.
Fret till your proud heart break.
Go show your slaves how choleric you are And make your bondmen tremble.
Must I budge?
Must I observe you?
Must I stand and crouch Under your testy humor?
By the gods, You shall digest the venom of your spleen, Though it do split you.
For from this day forth, I’ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter, When you are waspish.
Is it come to this?
You say you are a better soldier.
Let it appear so.
Make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well.
For mine own part, I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
You wrong me every way.
You wrong me, Brutus.
I said an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say “better”?
If you did, I care not.
When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
Peace, peace!
You durst not so have tempted him.
I durst not!
No.
What, durst not tempt him?
