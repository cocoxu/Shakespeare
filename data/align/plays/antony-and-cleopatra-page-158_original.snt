Thanks to my lord.
The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak, Your reconciler!
Wars ’twixt you twain would be As if the world should cleave, and that slain men Should solder up the rift.
When it appears to you where this begins, Turn your displeasure that way, for our faults Can never be so equal that your love Can equally move with them.
Provide your going; Choose your own company and command what cost Your heart has mind to.
