Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee, For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is.
He hath the jewel of my life in hold, His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca, And her withholds from me and other more, Suitors to her and rivals in my love, Supposing it a thing impossible, For those defects I have before rehearsed, That ever Katherina will be wooed.
Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en, That none shall have access unto Bianca Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.
Katherine the curst!” A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace, And offer me disguised in sober robes To old Baptista as a schoolmaster Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca, That so I may, by this device at least, Have leave and leisure to make love to her And, unsuspected, court her by herself.
