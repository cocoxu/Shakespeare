Tis known before.
Our preparation stands In expectation of them.
O dear father, It is thy business that I go about.
Therefore great France My mourning and importuned tears hath pitied.
No blown ambition doth our arms incite, But love—dear love!—and our aged father’s right.
Soon may I hear and see him.
