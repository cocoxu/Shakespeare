For your life you durst not.
Do not presume too much upon my love.
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats, For I am armed so strong in honesty That they pass by me as the idle wind, Which I respect not.
I did send to you For certain sums of gold, which you denied me, For I can raise no money by vile means.
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart And drop my blood for drachmas than to wring From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash By any indirection.
I did send To you for gold to pay my legions, Which you denied me.
Was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous To lock such rascal counters from his friends, Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts.
Dash him to pieces!
I denied you not.
You did.
I did not.
He was but a fool that brought My answer back.
Brutus hath rived my heart.
A friend should bear his friend’s infirmities, But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
I do not, till you practice them on me.
