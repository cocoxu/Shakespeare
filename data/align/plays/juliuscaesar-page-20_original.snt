Brutus” will start a spirit as soon as “Caesar.” Now in the names of all the gods at once, Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed That he is grown so great?
Age, thou art shamed!
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood, But it was famed with more than with one man?
When could they say till now, that talked of Rome, That her wide walks encompassed but one man?
Now is it Rome indeed, and room enough, When there is in it but one only man.
Oh, you and I have heard our fathers say, There was a Brutus once that would have brooked Th' eternal devil to keep his state in Rome As easily as a king.
That you do love me, I am nothing jealous.
What you would work me to, I have some aim.
How I have thought of this and of these times I shall recount hereafter.
For this present, I would not, so with love I might entreat you, Be any further moved.
What you have said I will consider, what you have to say I will with patience hear, and find a time Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: Brutus had rather be a villager Than to repute himself a son of Rome Under these hard conditions as this time Is like to lay upon us.
I am glad that my weak words Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
