All’s well.
I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters: To you they have showed some truth.
I think not of them.
Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve, We would spend it in some words upon that business, If you would grant the time.
At your kind’st leisure.
If you shall cleave to my consent, when ’tis, It shall make honor for you.
So I lose none In seeking to augment it, but still keep My bosom franchised and allegiance clear, I shall be counselled.
Good repose the while!
Thanks, sir: the like to you!
She strike upon the bell.
Get thee to bed.
Is this a dagger which I see before me, The handle toward my hand?
Come, let me clutch thee.
I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible To feeling as to sight?
Or art thou but A dagger of the mind, a false creation, Proceeding from the heat-oppressèd brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable As this which now I draw.
Thou marshall’st me the way that I was going, And such an instrument I was to use.
Mine eyes are made the fools o' th' other senses, Or else worth all the rest.
I see thee still, And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, Which was not so before.
There’s no such thing.
It is the bloody business which informs Thus to mine eyes.
Now o'er the one half-world Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse The curtained sleep.
Witchcraft celebrates Pale Hecate’s offerings, and withered murder, Alarumed by his sentinel, the wolf, Whose howl’s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace, With Tarquin’s ravishing strides, towards his design Moves like a ghost.
Thou sure and firm-set earth, Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear Thy very stones prate of my whereabout, And take the present horror from the time, Which now suits with it.
Whiles I threat, he lives.
Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
