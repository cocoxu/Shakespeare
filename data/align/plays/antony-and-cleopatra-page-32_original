How now, lady?
I would I had thy inches.
Thou shouldst know There were a heart in Egypt.
Hear me, Queen: The strong necessity of time commands Our services awhile, but my full heart Remains in use with you.
Our Italy Shines o’er with civil swords.
Sextus Pompeius Makes his approaches to the port of Rome.
Equality of two domestic powers Breed scrupulous faction.
The hated, grown to strength, Are newly grown to love.
The condemned Pompey, Rich in his father’s honor, creeps apace Into the hearts of such as have not thrived Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten; And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge By any desperate change.
My more particular, And that which most with you should safe my going, Is Fulvia’s death.
Though age from folly could not give me freedom, It does from childishness.
Can Fulvia die?
She’s dead, my Queen.
