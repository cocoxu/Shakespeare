God and our good cause fight upon our side.
The prayers of holy saints and wrongèd souls, Like high-reared bulwarks, stand before our faces.
Richard except, those whom we fight against Had rather have us win than him they follow.
For what is he they follow?
Truly, gentlemen, A bloody tyrant and a homicide; One raised in blood, and one in blood established; One that made means to come by what he hath, And slaughtered those that were the means to help him; A base foul stone, made precious by the foil Of England’s chair, where he is falsely set; One that hath ever been God’s enemy.
Then if you fight against God’s enemy, God will, in justice, ward you as his soldiers.
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down, You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain.
If you do fight against your country’s foes, Your country’s fat shall pay your pains the hire.
If you do fight in safeguard of your wives, Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors.
If you do free your children from the sword, Your children’s children quits it in your age.
Then, in the name of God and all these rights, Advance your standards.
Draw your willing swords.
For me, the ransom of my bold attempt Shall be this cold corpse on the earth’s cold face; But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt The least of you shall share his part thereof.
Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully; God and Saint George!
Richmond and victory!
