Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced.
Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octavius yet.
Hie hence, and tell him so.—Yet, stay awhile.
Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse Into the marketplace.
There shall I try, In my oration, how the people take The cruèl issue of these bloody men.
According to the which, thou shalt discourse To young Octavius of the state of things.
Lend me your hand.
