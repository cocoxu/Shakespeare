<A NAME=speech1><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.1>In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.2>It wearies me; you say it wearies you;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.3>But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.4>What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.5>I am to learn;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.6>And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.7>That I have much ado to know myself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.8>Your mind is tossing on the ocean;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.9>There, where your argosies with portly sail,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.10>Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.11>Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.12>Do overpeer the petty traffickers,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.13>That curtsy to them, do them reverence,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.14>As they fly by them with their woven wings.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.15>Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.16>The better part of my affections would</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.17>Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.18>Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.19>Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.20>And every object that might make me fear</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.21>Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.22>Would make me sad.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.23>                  My wind cooling my broth</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.24>Would blow me to an ague, when I thought</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.25>What harm a wind too great at sea might do.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.26>I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.27>But I should think of shallows and of flats,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.28>And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.29>Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.30>To kiss her burial. Should I go to church</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.31>And see the holy edifice of stone,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.32>And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.33>Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.34>Would scatter all her spices on the stream,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.35>Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.36>And, in a word, but even now worth this,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.37>And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.38>To think on this, and shall I lack the thought</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.39>That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.40>But tell not me; I know, Antonio</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.41>Is sad to think upon his merchandise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.42>Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.43>My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.44>Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.45>Upon the fortune of this present year:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.46>Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.47>Why, then you are in love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.48>Fie, fie!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.49>Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.50>Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.51>For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.52>Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.53>Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.54>Some that will evermore peep through their eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.55>And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.56>And other of such vinegar aspect</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.57>That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.58>Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>SALANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.59>Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.60>Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.61>We leave you now with better company.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.62>I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.63>If worthier friends had not prevented me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.64>Your worth is very dear in my regard.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.65>I take it, your own business calls on you</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.66>And you embrace the occasion to depart.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.67>Good morrow, my good lords.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.68>Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.69>You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>SALARINO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.70>We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Salarino and Salanio</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>LORENZO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.71>My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.72>We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.73>I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.74>I will not fail you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.75>You look not well, Signior Antonio;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.76>You have too much respect upon the world:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.77>They lose it that do buy it with much care:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.78>Believe me, you are marvellously changed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.79>I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.80>A stage where every man must play a part,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.81>And mine a sad one.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.82>Let me play the fool:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.83>With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.84>And let my liver rather heat with wine</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.85>Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.86>Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.87>Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.88>Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.89>By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.90>I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.91>There are a sort of men whose visages</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.92>Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.93>And do a wilful stillness entertain,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.94>With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.95>Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.96>As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.97>And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.98>O my Antonio, I do know of these</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.99>That therefore only are reputed wise</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.100>For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.101>If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.102>Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.103>I'll tell thee more of this another time:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.104>But fish not, with this melancholy bait,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.105>For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.106>Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.107>I'll end my exhortation after dinner.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>LORENZO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.108>Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.109>I must be one of these same dumb wise men,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.110>For Gratiano never lets me speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.111>Well, keep me company but two years moe,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.112>Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.113>Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>GRATIANO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.114>Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.115>In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.116>Is that any thing now?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.117>Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.118>than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.119>grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.120>shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.121>have them, they are not worth the search.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.122>Well, tell me now what lady is the same</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.123>To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.124>That you to-day promised to tell me of?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.125>'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.126>How much I have disabled mine estate,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.127>By something showing a more swelling port</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.128>Than my faint means would grant continuance:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.129>Nor do I now make moan to be abridged</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.130>From such a noble rate; but my chief care</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.131>Is to come fairly off from the great debts</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.132>Wherein my time something too prodigal</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.133>Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.134>I owe the most, in money and in love,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.135>And from your love I have a warranty</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.136>To unburden all my plots and purposes</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.137>How to get clear of all the debts I owe.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>ANTONIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.138>I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.139>And if it stand, as you yourself still do,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.140>Within the eye of honour, be assured,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.141>My purse, my person, my extremest means,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.142>Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>BASSANIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.143>In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.144>I shot his fellow of the self-same flight</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.145>The self-same way with more advised watch,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.146>To find the other forth, and by adventuring both</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.147>I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.148>Because what follows is pure innocence.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.149>I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.150>That which I owe is lost; but if you please</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.151>To shoot another arrow that self way</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.152>Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.153>As I will watch the aim, or to find both</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.154>Or bring your latter hazard back again</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.155>And thankfully rest debtor for the first.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<A NAME=1.1.157>To wind about my love with circumstance;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.158>And out of doubt you do me now more wrong</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.159>In making question of my uttermost</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.160>Than if you had made waste of all I have:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.161>Then do but say to me what I should do</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.162>That in your knowledge may by me be done,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.163>And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.165>And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.166>Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.167>I did receive fair speechless messages:</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.4.1>Madam, although I speak it in your presence,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.2>You have a noble and a true conceit</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.3>Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.4>In bearing thus the absence of your lord.</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.5>But if you  knew to whom you show this honour,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.6>How true a gentleman you send relief,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.7>How dear a lover of my lord your husband,</A><br>

<A NAME=3.4.13>Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.14>There must be needs a like proportion</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.15>Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.16>Which makes me think that this Antonio,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.17>Being the bosom lover of my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.18>Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.19>How little is the cost I have bestow'd</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.20>In purchasing the semblance of my soul</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.21>From out the state of hellish misery!</A><br>
<A NAME=3.4.22>This comes too near the praising of myself;</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>LAUNCELOT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.1>Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.2>are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.3>promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.4>you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.5>therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.6>are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.7>you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.8>hope neither.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>JESSICA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.9>And what hope is that, I pray thee?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>LAUNCELOT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.10>Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.11>not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>JESSICA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.12>That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>LAUNCELOT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.14>Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>LAUNCELOT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.20>Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.21>enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.22>another. This making Christians will raise the</A><br>

<p><i>Enter LORENZO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>JESSICA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.25>I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.26>I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>JESSICA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.28>Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.29>are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.30>me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.31>says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.32>for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.33>price of pork.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>LORENZO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.34>I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.35>you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.36>Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>LAUNCELOT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.37>It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.38>but if she be less than an honest woman, she is</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.39>indeed more than I took her for.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>LORENZO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3.5.40>How every fool can play upon the word! I think the</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.41>best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.42>and discourse grow commendable in none only but</A><br>
<A NAME=3.5.43>parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.</A><br>
