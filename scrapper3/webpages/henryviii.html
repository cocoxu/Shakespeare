<H3>ACT I</h3>
<h3>PROLOGUE</h3>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.0.1>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.2>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.3>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.4>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.5>We now present. Those that can pity, here</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.6>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.7>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.8>Their money out of hope they may believe,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.9>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.10>Only a show or two, and so agree</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.11>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.12>I'll undertake may see away their shilling</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.13>Richly in two short hours. Only they</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.14>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.15>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.16>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.17>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.18>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.19>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.20>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.21>To make that only true we now intend,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.22>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.23>Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.24>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.25>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.26>The very persons of our noble story</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.27>As they were living; think you see them great,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.28>And follow'd with the general throng and sweat</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.29>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.30>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.31>And, if you can be merry then, I'll say</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.32>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.21>To one above itself. Each following day</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.22>Became the next day's master, till the last</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.23>Made former wonders its. To-day the French,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.24>All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.25>Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.26>Made Britain India: every man that stood</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.27>Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.28>As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.29>Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.30>The pride upon them, that their very labour</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.31>Was to them as a painting: now this masque</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.32>Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.33>Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.34>Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.35>As presence did present them; him in eye,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.36>Still him in praise: and, being present both</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.37>'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.38>Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.39>For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.40>The noble spirits to arms, they did perform</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.41>Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.42>Being now seen possible enough, got credit,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.43>That Bevis was believed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.60>The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.61>From his ambitious finger. What had he</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.62>To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.63>That such a keech can with his very bulk</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.64>Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.65>And keep it from the earth.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>NORFOLK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.66>Surely, sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.67>There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.68>For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.69>Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.70>For high feats done to the crown; neither allied</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.73>The force of his own merit makes his way</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.74>A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.78>Pierce into that; but I can see his pride</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.79>Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.80>If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.81>Or has given all before, and he begins</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.85>Without the privity o' the king, to appoint</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.86>Who should attend on him? He makes up the file</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.88>To whom as great a charge as little honour</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.89>He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=1.1.97>Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.98>For this great journey. What did this vanity</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.99>But minister communication of</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.127>What his high hatred would effect wants not</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.128>A minister in his power. You know his nature,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.129>That he's revengeful, and I know his sword</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.17>I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.18>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.19>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.20>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.21>The king's attorney on the contrary</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.22>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.23>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.24>To have brought viva voce to his face:</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.25>At which appear'd against him his surveyor;</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.26>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.27>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.28>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.31>The same.</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.32>All these accused him strongly; which he fain</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.33>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.34>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.35>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.36>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.37>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.38>After all this, how did he bear himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.39>When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.40>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.41>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.42>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.43>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.44>In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.45>I do not think he fears death.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.46>Sure, he does not:</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.47>He never was so womanish; the cause</A><br>
<A NAME=2.1.48>He may a little grieve at.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2.1.49>Certainly</A><br>

<A NAME=2.4.195>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.196>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.197>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.198>That many mazed considerings did throng</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.199>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.200>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.201>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.202>If it conceived a male child by me, should</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.203>Do no more offices of life to't than</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.204>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.205>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.206>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.207>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.208>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.209>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.210>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.211>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.212>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.213>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.214>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.215>Now present here together: that's to say,</A><br>
<A NAME=2.4.216>I meant to rectify my conscience,--which</A><br>

<A NAME=4.1.106>Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.107>To a prepared place in the choir, fell off</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.108>A distance from her; while her grace sat down</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.109>To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,</A><br>
