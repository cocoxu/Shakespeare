<A NAME=1.1.54>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.55>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.56>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.57>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.58>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.59>And never noted in him any study,</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.78>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.79>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.81>And in regard of causes now in hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.82>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</A><br>

<A NAME=1.2.11>My learned lord, we pray you to proceed</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.12>And justly and religiously unfold</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.13>Why the law Salique that they have in France</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.14>Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:</A><br>

<A NAME=1.2.18>With opening titles miscreate, whose right</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.2.35>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.36>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.37>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.38>To make against your highness' claim to France</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.39>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.40>'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.41>'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.42>Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.43>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.44>The founder of this law and female bar.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.45>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.46>That the land Salique is in Germany,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.47>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.48>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.49>There left behind and settled certain French;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.50>Who, holding in disdain the German women</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.51>For some dishonest manners of their life,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.52>Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.53>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.54>Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.55>Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.56>Then doth it well appear that Salique law</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.57>Was not devised for the realm of France:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.58>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.59>Until four hundred one and twenty years</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.60>After defunction of King Pharamond,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.61>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.62>Who died within the year of our redemption</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.63>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.64>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.65>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.66>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.67>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.68>Did, as heir general, being descended</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.69>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.70>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.71>Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.72>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.73>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.74>To find his title with some shows of truth,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.75>'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.76>Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.77>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.78>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.79>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.80>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.81>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.82>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.83>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.84>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.85>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.86>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.87>Was re-united to the crown of France.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.88>So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.89>King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.90>King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.91>To hold in right and title of the female:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.92>So do the kings of France unto this day;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.93>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.94>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.95>And rather choose to hide them in a net</A><br>
<A NAME=1.2.96>Than amply to imbar their crooked titles</A><br>

<A NAME=3.2.25>As young as I am, I have observed these three</A><br>

<A NAME=3.2.27>three, though they would serve me, could not be man</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.28>to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to</A><br>

<A NAME=3.2.30>red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.31>fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.32>and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.33>words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.34>heard that men of few words are the best men; and</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.35>therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.36>should be thought a coward: but his few bad words</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.37>are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.38>broke any man's head but his own, and that was</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.39>against a post when he was drunk. They will steal</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.40>any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.41>lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.42>three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.43>brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.44>fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the</A><br>

<A NAME=3.2.46>familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.47>handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.48>if I should take from another's pocket to put into</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.49>mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I</A><br>
<A NAME=3.2.50>must leave them, and seek some better service:</A><br>

<A NAME=4.1.159>the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.160>unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.161>the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.162>some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of</A><br>

<A NAME=4.1.167>though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.168>fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.169>so that here men are punished for before-breach of</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.170>the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.171>they feared the death, they have borne life away;</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.172>and where they would be safe, they perish: then if</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.173>they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.174>their damnation than he was before guilty of those</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.175>impieties for the which they are now visited. Every</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.176>subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.177>soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.178>the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every</A><br>
<A NAME=4.1.179>mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death</A><br>

<A NAME=5.2.152>that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the</A><br>

<A NAME=5.2.158>can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.159>always reason themselves out again. What! a</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.160>speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A</A><br>

<A NAME=5.2.166>shines bright and never changes, but keeps his</A><br>
