<A NAME=speech3><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.3>Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in</A><br>

<A NAME=0.1.5>Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.7>No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold</A><br>

<A NAME=0.1.13>and kindly.</A><br>
<p><i>Falls asleep</i></p>
<p><i>Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</i></p>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.14>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.15>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.16>And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.17>Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.18>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.19>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</A><br>

<A NAME=0.1.21>He cried upon it at the merest loss</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.22>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.24>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.25>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.26>But sup them well and look unto them all:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.27>To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>First Huntsman</b></a>

<A NAME=0.1.28>I will, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Lord</b></a>

<A NAME=0.1.29>What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>Second Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.30>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>

<A NAME=0.1.34>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.35>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.36>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.37>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.38>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.39>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Second Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.41>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.42>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.43>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.44>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.45>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.46>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.47>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.48>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.49>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.50>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.51>And with a low submissive reverence</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.52>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.53>Let one attend him with a silver basin</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.54>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.55>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.56>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.57>Some one be ready with a costly suit</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.58>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.59>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.60>And that his lady mourns at his disease:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.61>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.62>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.63>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.64>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.65>It will be pastime passing excellent,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.66>If it be husbanded with modesty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.67>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.68>As he shall think by our true diligence</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.69>He is no less than what we say he is.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.70>Take him up gently and to bed with him;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.71>And each one to his office when he wakes.</A><br>
<p><i>Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds</i></p>
<A NAME=0.1.72>Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:</A><br>
<p><i>Exit Servingman</i></p>

<A NAME=0.1.77>That offer service to your lordship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.78>Bid them come near.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Players</i></p>
<A NAME=0.1.79>Now, fellows, you are welcome.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>Players</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.80>We thank your honour.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.81>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.82>So please your lordship to accept our duty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.83>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.84>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.85>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.86>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.87>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.88>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.89>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.90>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.91>The rather for I have some sport in hand</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.92>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.93>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.94>But I am doubtful of your modesties;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.95>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.96>For yet his honour never heard a play--</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.97>You break into some merry passion</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.98>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.99>If you should smile he grows impatient.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.100>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.101>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=0.1.102>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.103>And give them friendly welcome every one:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.104>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit one with the Players</i></p>
<A NAME=0.1.105>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.106>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.107>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.108>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.109>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.110>He bear himself with honourable action,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.111>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.112>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.113>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.114>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.115>And say 'What is't your honour will command,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.116>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.117>May show her duty and make known her love?'</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.118>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.119>And with declining head into his bosom,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.120>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.121>To see her noble lord restored to health,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.122>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.123>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.124>And if the boy have not a woman's gift</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.125>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.126>An onion will do well for such a shift,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.127>Which in a napkin being close convey'd</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.128>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.129>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.130>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit a Servingman</i></p>
<A NAME=0.1.131>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.132>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.133>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.134>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.135>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.136>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.137>May well abate the over-merry spleen</A><br>
<A NAME=0.1.138>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</A><br>

<A NAME=5.2.169>And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.170>And not obedient to his honest will,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.171>What is she but a foul contending rebel</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.172>And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.173>I am ashamed that women are so simple</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.174>To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.175>Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.176>When they are bound to serve, love and obey.</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.177>Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.178>Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.179>But that our soft conditions and our hearts</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.180>Should well agree with our external parts?</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.181>Come, come, you froward and unable worms!</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.182>My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.183>My heart as great, my reason haply more,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.184>To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.185>But now I see our lances are but straws,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.186>Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.187>That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.188>Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.189>And place your hands below your husband's foot:</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.190>In token of which duty, if he please,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.2.191>My hand is ready; may it do him ease.</A><br>
