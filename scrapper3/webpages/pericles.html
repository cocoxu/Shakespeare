<A NAME=1.0.28>To evil should be done by none:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.29>But custom what they did begin</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.30>Was with long use account no sin.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.0.31>The beauty of this sinful dame</A><br>

<A NAME=5.3.7>At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.8>At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.9>A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.10>Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.11>Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.12>He sought to murder: but her better stars</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.13>Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.14>Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.15>Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she</A><br>
<A NAME=5.3.16>Made known herself my daughter.</A><br>
